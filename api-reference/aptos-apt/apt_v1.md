}
```

## Response Definition

| Value | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chain_id` | integer | ID of the blockchain |
| `epoch` | string | Current epoch number |
| `ledger_version` | string | The latest version of the ledger |
| `oldest_ledger_version` | string | The earliest version of the ledger |
| `ledger_timestamp` | string | Timestamp of the latest ledger version in microseconds |
| `node_role` | string | Role of this node in the network |
| `oldest_block_height` | string | Lowest block height available |
| `block_height` | string | Current block height |
| `git_hash` | string | Git hash of the node build |

## Use Case

The `/v1/info` endpoint is useful for checking if a node is online and responding.  
For example:

* Developers can verify the latest block or ledger version to ensure the node is up-to-date.
    
* Applications can notify users about the health of the blockchain, such as showing a modal alerting them to the current state when they log in to a dApp.
    

## Code Example (Axios)

```js
import axios from 'axios'

let config = {
  method: 'get',
  maxBodyLength: Infinity,
  url: 'https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS_TOKEN>/v1/info',
  headers: {}
};

axios.request(config)
.then((response) => {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
})
.catch((error) => {
  console.log(error);
});
```

> Replace `<ACCESS_TOKEN>` with your actual access token from GetBlock.

## Error Handling

When using this endpoint, you may encounter:

* **404** → Incorrect or incomplete access token.
    
* **500** → Network issues.
    

**How to fix**:

* Use a stable and strong network connection.
    
* Check or re-copy your access token.
    
* Verify the URL to ensure it is correct and complete.
    

## Integration

It is recommended to use this endpoint first to check the current status of the blockchain before integrating other endpoints into your application.
