{% endhint %}

The debug_traceBlockByNumber Web3 method in the BSC protocol allows developers to trace the execution of a specific block by its number. This JSON-RPC API method provides detailed insights into the operations and smart contract interactions within the block, enabling users to analyze transaction execution and debug issues effectively. By utilizing the debug_traceBlockByNumber RPC protocol, developers can access detailed execution traces, including opcode execution, stack, memory, and storage details. This tool is essential for diagnosing complex smart contract behaviors, optimizing performance, and ensuring the integrity of decentralized applications running on the Binance Smart Chain.

### Supported Networks

The debug_traceBlockByNumber REST API method supports the following network types
- **Mainnet**
- **Testnets**

### Parameters

Here is the list of parameters debug_traceBlockByNumber method needs to be executed:

- **Block Number (required)**
  - **Type:** String
  - **Description:** Specifies the block number to be traced. It should be provided in hexadecimal format prefixed with "0x".
  - **Supported Values:** Any valid block number in hexadecimal format.

- **Options (optional)**
  - **Type:** Object
  - **Description:** An object containing additional options for tracing.
  - **Supported Values:** 
    - **tracer:** Specifies the type of tracer to use. In this case, "callTracer" is used, which traces calls made during the execution of a transaction.

### Request Example

#### API Endpoint

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```
Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using debug_traceBlockByNumber

#### Request

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {"jsonrpc": "2.0",
"method": "debug_traceBlockByNumber",
"params": ["0xA1", {"tracer": "callTracer"}],
"id": "getblock.io"}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Response


```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "getblock.io",
  "error": {
    "code": -32000,
    "message": "historical state not available in path scheme yet"
  }
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for debug_traceBlockByNumber method:

1. **jsonrpc**: The version of the JSON-RPC protocol being used. Typically, this is "2.0".
2. **id**: A unique identifier for the request. This can be any string or number and is used to match responses to requests.
3. **error**: An object containing details about any error that occurred during the execution of the method.
   - **code**: A numeric code representing the specific error that occurred.
   - **message**: A descriptive message providing more information about the error.

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for debug_traceBlockByNumber method:

1. **Transaction Analysis**: This method is particularly useful for developers and blockchain analysts who need to perform an in-depth analysis of all transactions within a specific block. By tracing the execution of each transaction, developers can identify issues such as failed transactions, gas consumption, and understand the sequence of contract calls. This level of detail is essential for optimizing smart contracts and ensuring efficient execution.

2. **Security Auditing**: In the realm of blockchain security, auditing smart contracts for vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior is crucial. The debug_traceBlockByNumber method allows security auditors to trace the execution paths of smart contracts within a block, helping them to detect anomalies, reentrancy attacks, or other security issues that might not be evident from the transaction receipts alone. This detailed tracing helps in ensuring the robustness and security of smart contracts before they are deployed on the mainnet.

3. **Historical Debugging**: When developers are troubleshooting issues that occurred in the past, they can use this method to replay and analyze the transactions in a specific block. This is particularly useful for debugging complex issues that require understanding the state and behavior of a contract at a particular point in time. By examining past blocks, developers can gain insights into the conditions that led to a bug or unexpected behavior, facilitating more effective debugging and resolution.

### Code for debug_traceBlockByNumber

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "getblock.io",
  "error": {
    "code": -32000,
    "message": "historical state not available in path scheme yet"
  }
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```

## Common Errors

Common Errors  
When using the debug_traceBlockByNumber JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:  
- Incorrect block number format: Ensure the block number is provided in hexadecimal format prefixed with "0x". Double-check the input to avoid decimal or improperly formatted values.  
- Insufficient node resources: Tracing a block can be resource-intensive, leading to timeouts or memory issues. Consider increasing the node's computational resources or using a more powerful node setup.  
- Tracer configuration errors: If the tracer option is misconfigured or unsupported, the method may fail. Verify that the tracer is correctly specified and supported by the node version in use.  
- Network connectivity issues: Problems with network connectivity between the client and the node can cause request failures. Ensure stable network conditions and verify node accessibility.

Using the debug_traceBlockByNumber method provides valuable insights into the execution of transactions within a block, making it an essential tool for debugging and analyzing smart contracts in Web3 applications. By leveraging this method, developers can gain a deeper understanding of transaction flows and optimize their decentralized applications for better performance and reliability.

### conclusion

The debug_traceBlockByNumber JSON-RPC method is a powerful tool for developers working on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), allowing them to trace and debug transactions within a specific block by its number. By using this method with parameters like a call tracer, developers can gain detailed insights into the execution of smart contracts and identify potential issues. This functionality is essential for maintaining the robustness and reliability of applications on BSC.
