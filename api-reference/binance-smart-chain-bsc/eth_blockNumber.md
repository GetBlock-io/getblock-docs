# eth_blockNumber

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC method retrieves the latest block number on the Binance Smart Chain, providing the current state of the blockchain for synchronization or monitoring purposes.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The eth_blockNumber Web3 method is a crucial part of interacting with the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) via the JSON-RPC API. It allows users to query the most recent block number on the blockchain, providing a snapshot of the network's current state. By returning the latest block number, developers can synchronize their applications with the blockchain, ensuring they are working with the most up-to-date data. The eth_blockNumber RPC protocol is designed for efficiency and ease of use, making it an essential tool for developers working with BSC. Whether you're building decentralized applications or monitoring blockchain activity, this method helps maintain accurate and timely data access.

### Supported Networks

The eth_blockNumber REST API method supports the following network types
- **Mainnet**
- **Testnets**

### Parameters

None: This method does not require any parameters.

### Request Example

#### API Endpoint

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```
Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using eth_blockNumber

#### Request

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_blockNumber",
  "params": [],
  "id": "getblock.io"
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Response


```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "getblock.io",
  "result": "0x2e64326"
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for eth_blockNumber method:

1. jsonrpc: The version of the JSON-RPC protocol being used, typically "2.0".
2. id: A unique identifier for the request, which can be used to match the response with the request.
3. result: The hexadecimal representation of the current block number.

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for eth_blockNumber method:

1. **Synchronization Check**: One of the primary uses of this method is to check the synchronization status of a blockchain node. By regularly querying the latest block number, developers can determine if their node is up-to-date with the network. This is crucial for applications that rely on real-time data, such as decentralized exchanges or other financial services, to ensure they are operating on the most current state of the blockchain.

2. **Transaction Confirmation**: In decentralized applications, it's important to confirm transactions after they are mined. By using the block number, developers can track how many blocks have been added to the chain since a particular transaction was included. This helps in determining the number of confirmations a transaction has received, which is often used as a measure of security and finality.

3. **Event Monitoring**: For applications that need to monitor specific events on the blockchain, knowing the current block number is essential. Developers can use this information to efficiently scan through blocks and detect events of interest, such as specific contract interactions or changes in state. This is particularly useful for services that provide analytics or notifications based on blockchain activity.

### Code for eth_blockNumber

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "getblock.io",
  "result": "0x2e64326"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Common Errors

Common Errors  
When using the eth_blockNumber JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:  
- Network latency can result in delayed responses. To mitigate this, ensure your network connection is stable and consider implementing retry logic with exponential backoff.  
- An improperly configured endpoint can lead to failed requests. Verify that the endpoint URL is correct and the server is operational.  
- Rate limiting by the service provider might block requests if too many are made in a short period. Monitor your request rate and implement rate limiting in your application to avoid this issue.  
- Invalid JSON-RPC request format can cause errors. Ensure that your request adheres to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification with correct method names and parameter structures.  

Using the eth_blockNumber method in Web3 applications provides a straightforward way to retrieve the latest block number, which is crucial for tasks such as transaction tracking and network synchronization. This method enhances the efficiency and reliability of blockchain interactions by allowing applications to stay up-to-date with the current state of the blockchain.

### conclusion

The eth_blockNumber method in JSON-RPC is essential for retrieving the latest block number on blockchain networks like Ethereum and BSC. By using this method, developers can efficiently track the current state of the blockchain, facilitating actions such as transaction verification and network monitoring. This makes eth_blockNumber a critical component for maintaining up-to-date blockchain applications.
