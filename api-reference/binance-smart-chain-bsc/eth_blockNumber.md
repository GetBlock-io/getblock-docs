# eth\_blockNumber - BNB Smart Chain

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC method for BSC retrieves the latest block number, helping users track blockchain progress and synchronize with the network.
{% endhint %}

The `eth_blockNumber` method in the JSON-RPC API retrieves the current block number in the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) network. As part of the `eth_blockNumber` Web3 interface, it provides developers with the latest block's index, facilitating real-time blockchain data access for applications interacting with BSC.

Utilizing the `eth_blockNumber` RPC protocol, this method returns the block number as a hexadecimal string, ensuring seamless integration with applications that require blockchain synchronization. This functionality is crucial for monitoring and verifying transactions, enabling efficient blockchain operations and development.

### Supported Networks

The `eth_blockNumber` JSON-RPC API method supports the following network types:

* **Mainnet**
* **Testnet**

### Parameters

None: This method does not require any parameters.

## Request Example

**API Endpoint**

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```

**Request**

Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using `eth_blockNumbe`r :

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_blockNumber",
  "params": [],
  "id": "getblock.io"
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="wss" %}
```json
wscat -c wss://go.getblock.io/{ACCESS_TOKEN}/
{"jsonrpc": "2.0",
"method": "eth_blockNumber",
"params": [],
"id": "getblock.io"}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Response**

Below is a sample JSON response returned by `eth_blockNumber` upon a successful call:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "getblock.io",
  "result": "0x2e64326"
}
```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for the `eth_blockNumber` method:

1. **`jsonrpc`**: Specifies the version of the JSON-RPC protocol being used. In this case, it is `"2.0"`.
2. **`id`**: A unique identifier for the request. This can be a string, number, or null. In the example, it is `"getblock.io"`.
3. **`result`**: The result of the method call, which is the current block number in hexadecimal format. In the example, it is `"0x2e64326"`.

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for `eth_blockNumber` method:

1. **Synchronizing Blockchain Data**: Developers often use the `eth_blockNumber` method to determine the latest block number on the Ethereum blockchain. This information is crucial for applications that need to synchronize data with the blockchain, ensuring they are working with the most up-to-date information. For instance, a wallet application might use this method to check the current block number to confirm that all recent transactions have been successfully processed.
2. **Monitoring Blockchain Activity**: The `eth_blockNumber` method can be employed in monitoring tools that track blockchain activity. By continuously fetching the latest block number, these tools can detect when new blocks are added to the blockchain, allowing them to trigger alerts or update dashboards in real-time. This is particularly useful for developers who need to monitor the performance and status of the network.
3. **Smart Contract Event Listening**: When working with smart contracts, developers often need to listen for specific events emitted by the contracts. By using the `eth_blockNumber` method, developers can track the current block number and compare it against the block number where certain events were expected to occur. This helps in efficiently setting up event listeners that can process events only after the blockchain has reached a specific block height, optimizing the performance of decentralized applications.

### Code for eth\_blockNumber

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_blockNumber",
  "params": [],
  "id": "getblock.io"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/";
const payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_blockNumber",
  "params": [],
  "id": "getblock.io"
};

axios.post(url, payload, {
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
})
.then(response => {
  console.log("Result:", response.data.result);
})
.catch(error => {
  if (error.response) {
    console.error("Error:", error.response.status, error.response.data);
  } else {
    console.error("Request failed:", error.message);
  }
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Common Errors

When using the `eth_blockNumber` JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:

* Network Latency: High network latency can lead to delayed responses. Ensure a stable internet connection and consider using a local node or a reliable third-party provider to minimize delays.
* Rate Limiting: Exceeding the request rate limit can result in blocked requests. Implement exponential backoff strategies and optimize your request frequency to stay within the limits.
* Invalid JSON-RPC Request: Malformed JSON-RPC requests can lead to errors. Double-check the JSON structure and ensure all required fields are correctly specified.
* Node Synchronization: If the node is not fully synchronized, it might return outdated block numbers. Ensure your node is fully synced with the BSC network to get accurate results.

Using the `eth_blockNumber` method in Web3 applications provides real-time insights into the blockchain's current state, allowing developers to track the latest block number efficiently. This is essential for applications that need to monitor on-chain activities or validate transactions, ensuring they operate with the most up-to-date blockchain data.

### Conclusion

The `eth_blockNumber` method in JSON-RPC is a crucial tool for retrieving the most recent block number on the Ethereum blockchain, and it can also be used on other EVM-compatible chains like BSC. By regularly calling `eth_blockNumber`, developers can efficiently track and interact with the latest blockchain data.
