# eth_chainId

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC eth_chainId for BSC returns the unique identifier of the Binance Smart Chain network, ensuring correct network connections for transactions and data queries.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The `eth_chainId` method in the BSC protocol is a JSON-RPC API call that retrieves the unique identifier of the blockchain network. This method is crucial for applications to ensure they are interacting with the correct network. In the context of `eth_chainId Web3`, it helps developers verify network connections programmatically.

Utilizing the `eth_chainId RPC protocol`, this method returns a hexadecimal string representing the chain ID. This ID distinguishes between mainnets and testnets, aiding in network-specific operations. By invoking `eth_chainId`, developers can prevent cross-network errors, ensuring that their transactions and smart contract interactions occur on the intended blockchain.

## Supported Networks

The eth_chainId JSON-RPC API method supports the following network types:
- **Mainnet**
- **Testnet**

## Parameters

None: This method does not require any parameters.

# Request Example

##### API Endpoint

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```


#### Request

Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using eth_chainId :

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_chainId",
  "params": [],
  "id": "getblock.io"
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Response

Below is a sample JSON response returned by eth_chainId upon a successful call:

```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "getblock.io",
  "result": "0x38"
}

```

## Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for `eth_chainId` method:

1. **jsonrpc**: This is the version of the JSON-RPC protocol being used. In this case, it is "2.0".
2. **id**: A unique identifier for the request. Here, it is "getblock.io", which can be any string or number used to match the response with the request.
3. **result**: This represents the chain ID of the blockchain network in hexadecimal format. In this example, it is "0x38", which corresponds to the Binance Smart Chain mainnet.

## Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for `eth_chainId` method:

1. **Network Identification**: In Web3 programming, it's crucial to ensure that the application is interacting with the correct Ethereum network, whether it's the mainnet, a testnet, or a private network. The `eth_chainId` method helps in identifying the current network by returning a unique identifier for the blockchain. This is particularly useful when switching between different networks to prevent transactions from being sent to the wrong chain.

2. **Compatibility Checks**: When developing decentralized applications (dApps), it's important to ensure that the smart contracts and features are compatible with the network being used. By using the `eth_chainId` method, developers can programmatically check the network and conditionally execute code that is specific to certain networks, thus enhancing the robustness and reliability of the dApp.

3. **Security Measures**: Using the `eth_chainId` method can be part of security protocols to avoid phishing attacks or misconfigurations. By verifying the network ID, applications can prevent users from accidentally interacting with malicious or unintended networks, thereby safeguarding user funds and data.

## Code for eth_chainId

{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"

  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "getblock.io",
  "result": "0x38"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/";
const payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "getblock.io",
  "result": "0x38"
};

axios.post(url, payload, {
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
})
.then(response => {
  console.log("Result:", response.data.result);
})
.catch(error => {
  if (error.response) {
    console.error("Error:", error.response.status, error.response.data);
  } else {
    console.error("Request failed:", error.message);
  }
});
```

## Common Errors

When using the `eth_chainId` JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:
- Incorrect network ID: If the returned chain ID does not match the expected value for Binance Smart Chain, verify that your node is correctly configured to connect to the BSC network.
- Network connectivity issues: If you receive a timeout or no response, ensure your client is connected to the network and that there are no firewall rules blocking the request.
- Invalid JSON-RPC response: Receiving malformed JSON responses may indicate a problem with the node software. Update your node client to the latest version to resolve compatibility issues.
- Node synchronization lag: If the chain ID returned is outdated, your node might be out of sync. Ensure your node is fully synchronized with the network.

Using the `eth_chainId` method in Web3 applications ensures that your application is interacting with the correct blockchain network, which is crucial for maintaining consistent and reliable operations. This method provides a simple yet effective way to programmatically verify network identity, reducing the risk of executing transactions on the wrong chain.

## Conclusion

The `eth_chainId` method in JSON-RPC is crucial for identifying the specific blockchain network a client is interacting with, such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain (BSC). By calling `eth_chainId`, developers can ensure their applications are operating on the correct network, preventing potential mismatches and errors. This functionality is vital for maintaining seamless and secure interactions across different blockchain environments.
