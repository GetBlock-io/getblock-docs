# eth_chainId

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC eth_chainId for BSC returns the unique identifier for the Binance Smart Chain network, helping applications verify they’re connected to the correct blockchain.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The eth_chainId method in Web3 is a crucial component of the eth_chainId RPC protocol, designed to facilitate the identification of blockchain networks. When interacting with Binance Smart Chain (BSC) or other Ethereum-compatible networks, this method provides a simple yet effective way to determine the unique chain ID of the network you are connected to. By querying this method via the JSON-RPC API, developers can ensure that their applications are interfacing with the correct blockchain environment, preventing potential cross-network errors. This method returns the chain ID as a hexadecimal string, enhancing the reliability and accuracy of network-specific operations in decentralized applications.

### Supported Networks

The eth_chainId REST API method supports the following network types
- **Mainnet**
- **Testnets**

### Parameters

None: This method does not require any parameters.

### Request Example

#### API Endpoint

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```
Here’s a sample cURL request using eth_chainId

#### Request

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_chainId",
  "params": [],
  "id": "getblock.io"
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Response


```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "getblock.io",
  "result": "0x38"
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for eth_chainId method:

1. **jsonrpc**: This parameter specifies the version of the JSON-RPC protocol being used. In this case, it is "2.0".

2. **id**: This parameter is a unique identifier for the request. It is used to match the response with the request. In this example, it is "getblock.io".

3. **result**: This parameter contains the chain ID in hexadecimal format. In this example, the chain ID is "0x38".

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for eth_chainId method:

1. Network Identification: In Web3 programming, it's crucial to identify which Ethereum network a client is connected to, especially when interacting with multiple networks such as the Ethereum mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby, or other testnets. This method helps developers ensure that their applications are operating on the intended network, thereby avoiding potential issues like deploying contracts or executing transactions on the wrong network.

2. Application Configuration: Many decentralized applications (dApps) require specific configurations depending on the network they are interacting with. By using this method, developers can dynamically configure their applications to adapt to different network environments. For instance, they can load different contract addresses or API endpoints based on the network ID returned by this method.

3. Security Measures: Verifying the chain ID is an important security measure to prevent replay attacks. In scenarios where transactions could be replayed on different networks, checking the chain ID ensures that transactions are only valid on the intended network, thereby protecting users and their assets from unintended actions.

### Code for eth_chainId

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "getblock.io",
  "result": "0x38"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Common Errors

Common Errors  
When using the eth_chainId JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:  
- Incorrect endpoint configuration: If the endpoint URL is misconfigured or points to an incorrect network, the method may return an unexpected chain ID. Ensure your endpoint is correctly set to the desired BSC network.  
- Network congestion: High network traffic can lead to delayed responses or timeouts. Consider implementing retry logic or using a load-balanced node service to mitigate this issue.  
- Unauthorized access: If the node provider requires authentication and your request lacks valid credentials, the method may fail. Verify your API keys or authentication tokens are correctly configured.  
- Outdated client library: Using an outdated Web3 library can lead to compatibility issues with the latest protocol updates. Regularly update your libraries to ensure compatibility with the BSC network.  

Using the eth_chainId method in Web3 applications provides a reliable way to verify the network your application is interacting with, ensuring that transactions and interactions occur on the intended blockchain. This method enhances the security and accuracy of decentralized applications by preventing cross-network errors and facilitating seamless blockchain interactions.

### conclusion

The eth_chainId method in JSON-RPC is crucial for identifying the specific blockchain network being interacted with, such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain (BSC). This method helps ensure that transactions and smart contract interactions occur on the correct network, preventing costly mistakes. Understanding and utilizing eth_chainId is essential for developers working across multiple blockchains like BSC.
