# eth\_feeHistory - Binance Smart Chain

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC method retrieves historical gas fee data on BSC, aiding users in estimating transaction costs and optimizing gas usage.
{% endhint %}

The `eth_feeHistory` method in the BSC protocol provides a snapshot of historical gas fee data, crucial for understanding recent network activity. Utilizing the `eth_feeHistory Web3` interface, developers can retrieve information about gas prices over a range of recent blocks, aiding in more accurate fee estimations.

Through the `eth_feeHistory RPC protocol`, users can specify the number of blocks and the priority fee percentile to obtain detailed insights into gas price trends. This method is essential for optimizing transaction costs and enhancing the efficiency of applications interacting with the Binance Smart Chain.

### Common Errors

When using the `eth_feeHistory` JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:

* Insufficient block range: Specifying a block range that exceeds the maximum allowed by the network can result in an error. To fix this, ensure the block range parameter is within the network's limits.
* Incorrect percentile values: Providing percentile values outside the 0-100 range can lead to unexpected results or errors. Verify that your percentile array contains valid values to prevent this issue.
* Network latency: High network latency can cause delayed responses or timeouts when fetching fee history data. Implement retry logic or increase the timeout settings to mitigate this problem.

Using the `eth_feeHistory` method in Web3 applications provides valuable insights into gas fee trends, enabling developers to optimize transaction costs. By analyzing historical fee data, applications can offer users more accurate fee estimations, enhancing the overall user experience and transaction efficiency.

### Conclusion

The `eth_feeHistory` JSON-RPC method provides valuable insights into Ethereum's gas fee trends by returning historical gas data, which can be crucial for optimizing transaction costs. While primarily used on Ethereum, similar methods can be adapted for other networks like BSC to enhance transaction efficiency. Understanding `eth_feeHistory` can significantly aid in navigating the complex landscape of blockchain fees.
