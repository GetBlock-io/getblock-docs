# eth_feeHistory

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC method provides historical base fee, gas used, and reward data for recent blocks, aiding in gas price estimation on the Binance Smart Chain.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The eth_feeHistory Web3 method is an essential tool in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) protocol, designed to provide users with historical gas fee data. By leveraging the eth_feeHistory RPC protocol, developers and users can access a range of block-specific gas fee information, including base fee per gas and gas used ratios. This method aids in estimating transaction costs by offering a detailed view of past fee trends, enabling more informed decisions for future transactions. The eth_feeHistory method accepts parameters such as the number of blocks, the highest block number, and a reward percentile array, returning a structured response that includes base fee per gas and gas used ratio for each block. This functionality is crucial for optimizing transaction costs and improving the efficiency of smart contract interactions within the BSC ecosystem.

## Common Errors

Common Errors  
When using the eth_feeHistory JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:  
- Incorrect Block Parameter: Specifying an invalid block parameter, such as a block number that exceeds the current blockchain height, can lead to errors. Ensure that the block parameter is within the valid range and formatted correctly.  
- Invalid Percentile Values: Using percentile values outside the accepted range of 0 to 100 can result in errors. Double-check that your percentile values are within this range to avoid issues.  
- Network Latency: High network latency can cause timeouts when fetching fee history data. Consider implementing retry logic in your application to handle such scenarios gracefully.  
- Unsupported Parameters: Passing unsupported or additional parameters not recognized by the BSC method can lead to unexpected errors. Review the method documentation to ensure all parameters are valid.

Using the eth_feeHistory method in Web3 applications offers the advantage of accessing historical gas fee data, which can be critical for optimizing transaction costs. By understanding past fee trends, developers can make more informed decisions about transaction timing and pricing, ultimately enhancing the user experience in decentralized applications.

### conclusion

The eth_feeHistory JSON-RPC method is a valuable tool for retrieving historical gas fee data on the Ethereum network. By specifying parameters such as block count and percentile, users can gain insights into past transaction costs. This functionality is crucial for developers and analysts working with Ethereum or similar networks like BSC, as it aids in optimizing transaction strategies and understanding network congestion trends.
