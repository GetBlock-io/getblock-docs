https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```

**Request**

Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using `eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber` :

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber",
  "params": ["0xc5043f"],
  "id": "getblock.io"
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Response**

Below is a sample JSON response returned by `eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber` upon a successful call:

```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "getblock.io",
  "result": "0x157"
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for the `eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber` method:

1. **`jsonrpc`**: A string specifying the version of the JSON-RPC protocol. In this case, it is `"2.0"`.
2. **`id`**: A unique identifier for the request. This can be a string, number, or null. In this example, it is `"getblock.io"`.
3. **`result`**: A hexadecimal string representing the number of transactions in the block. In this example, it is `"0x157"`, which is the hexadecimal representation of the transaction count.

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for `eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber` method:

1. **Transaction Monitoring and Analytics**: Developers and analysts can use the `eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber` method to monitor the number of transactions within a specific block. This information can be crucial for understanding network activity, identifying periods of high congestion, or analyzing transaction patterns over time. By tracking transaction counts, stakeholders can make informed decisions related to network performance and scalability.
2. **Resource Allocation and Load Balancing**: For applications that interact heavily with the Ethereum blockchain, knowing the number of transactions in recent blocks can help optimize resource allocation. For instance, a wallet service might use this method to assess the current load on the network and adjust its transaction submission strategy accordingly. During periods of high transaction counts, the service might choose to delay non-urgent transactions or increase gas fees to ensure timely processing.
3. **Security and Anomaly Detection**: The `eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber` method can be part of a security monitoring system that detects unusual spikes in transaction activity. Sudden increases in transaction counts might indicate spam attacks or other malicious activities. By integrating this method into a broader monitoring framework, developers can set up alerts and take preemptive measures to protect the network or specific applications from potential threats.

}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```

{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/";
const payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber",
  "params": ["0xc5043f"],
  "id": "getblock.io"
};

axios.post(url, payload, {
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
})
.then(response => {
  console.log("Result:", response.data.result);
})
.catch(error => {
  if (error.response) {
    console.error("Error:", error.response.status, error.response.data);
  } else {
    console.error("Request failed:", error.message);
  }
});
```

### Common Errors

When using the `eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber` JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:

* Invalid block number format: Ensure the block number is provided in hexadecimal format with a '0x' prefix. Double-check the input to prevent format-related errors.
* Block not found: If the block number is not yet mined or does not exist, the method will return null. Verify the block number against the latest block to ensure its existence.
* Network connectivity issues: If there is a problem connecting to the BSC node, the request may fail. Check your network connection and node status to ensure proper connectivity.
* Rate limiting: Excessive requests to the BSC node can lead to rate limiting. Implement request throttling or use a load balancer to distribute requests evenly.

Using the `eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber` method in Web3 applications allows developers to efficiently retrieve the number of transactions in a specific block, aiding in transaction processing and analytics. This functionality is crucial for applications that require real-time data on block activity, enabling more responsive and dynamic user experiences.

### Conclusion

The JSON-RPC method `eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber` is a valuable tool for retrieving the number of transactions in a specific block on networks like Ethereum and BSC. By using this method, developers can efficiently monitor and analyze blockchain activity, enhancing their ability to manage applications and smart contracts.
