### Request Example

#### API Endpoint

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```
Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber

#### Request

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber",
  "params": ["0xc5043f"],
  "id": "getblock.io"
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Response


```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "getblock.io",
  "result": "0x157"
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber method:

1. `jsonrpc`: The version of the JSON-RPC protocol. In this case, it is "2.0".
2. `id`: An identifier for the request, which can be used to match the response with the request. Here, it is "getblock.io".
3. `result`: The number of transactions in the block, represented as a hexadecimal value. In this example, it is "0x157".

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber method:

1. **Blockchain Analysis**: This method can be used to analyze the activity level of specific blocks in the Ethereum blockchain. By retrieving the number of transactions in a block, developers and analysts can identify periods of high activity or congestion. This information can be useful for understanding network usage patterns, optimizing decentralized application performance, or planning infrastructure scaling.

2. **Transaction Monitoring and Alerts**: Developers can use this method to monitor the number of transactions in real-time and set up alerts for unusual activity. For instance, if a block has an unexpectedly high or low number of transactions, it might indicate a network issue, a large-scale transaction event, or even a potential security threat. Automated systems can be built to notify developers or trigger specific actions when such anomalies are detected.

3. **Resource Allocation and Fee Estimation**: By understanding the transaction count of recent blocks, developers can better estimate the current demand on the network and adjust their gas price strategies accordingly. This method helps in determining the optimal time to submit transactions to ensure faster confirmations at lower costs, which is crucial for applications that require timely execution or operate on a budget.

### Code for eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
