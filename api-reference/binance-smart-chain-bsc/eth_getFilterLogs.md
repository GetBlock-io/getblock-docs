    "code": -32000,
    "message": "filter not found"
  }
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for eth_getFilterLogs method:

1. **jsonrpc**: Specifies the version of the JSON-RPC protocol being used. Typically, this is "2.0".
   
2. **id**: A unique identifier for the request. It can be a string, number, or null, and is used to match the response with the request.

3. **method**: The name of the method to be invoked. For this case, it is eth_getFilterLogs.

4. **params**: An array containing the parameters for the method. For eth_getFilterLogs, it usually includes the filter ID for which the logs are being requested.

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for eth_getFilterLogs method:

1. **Tracking Event Emissions**: Developers can use this method to track specific events emitted by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By setting up a filter for particular event signatures, developers can retrieve logs that match the criteria, enabling them to monitor contract activities such as token transfers, contract upgrades, or any other significant occurrences within the blockchain ecosystem.

2. **Historical Data Analysis**: This method is useful for retrieving historical logs that match a given filter. This capability is particularly beneficial for applications that require analysis of past blockchain events, such as auditing transactions, analyzing market trends, or generating reports based on historical blockchain data.

3. **Real-time Monitoring**: By combining eth_getFilterLogs with other methods like eth_newFilter, developers can create a system for real-time monitoring of the blockchain. This setup allows for the continuous retrieval of logs as new blocks are added to the chain, facilitating applications that need to react promptly to blockchain events, such as automated trading systems or alerting mechanisms for specific on-chain activities.

## Common Errors

Common Errors  
When using the eth_getFilterLogs JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:  
- Invalid filter ID: If the filter ID provided is incorrect or expired, the method will return an empty result. Ensure the filter ID is active and correctly generated by a prior method like eth_newFilter.  
- Network latency or timeouts: High network traffic can lead to delays or timeouts when retrieving logs. Consider increasing the timeout settings or retrying the request to accommodate network conditions.  
- Node synchronization issues: If the node is not fully synchronized with the network, it might return incomplete or outdated logs. Verify that the node is fully synced before making requests.  
- Permission errors: Some nodes may have restricted access to certain methods. Ensure that your node provider allows access to the eth_getFilterLogs method and that your credentials are correctly configured.  

Using the eth_getFilterLogs method in Web3 applications allows developers to efficiently retrieve logs that match specific filter criteria, enabling real-time event monitoring and data analysis. This functionality is essential for building responsive and interactive decentralized applications, as it provides a reliable way to track on-chain events and state changes.

### conclusion

The eth_getFilterLogs method in JSON-RPC is a valuable tool for retrieving logs of specific events from the Ethereum blockchain, and it can also be applied to other EVM-compatible chains like BSC. By using this method, developers can efficiently monitor and respond to blockchain events, enhancing their applications' functionality and responsiveness.
