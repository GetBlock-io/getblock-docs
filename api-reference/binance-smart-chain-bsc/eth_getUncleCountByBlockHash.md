# eth_getUncleCountByBlockHash

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC method retrieves the number of uncles for a specific block identified by its hash on the Binance Smart Chain.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The eth_getUncleCountByBlockHash Web3 method is a crucial part of the JSON-RPC API, specifically designed for developers working with the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). This method allows users to retrieve the number of uncles associated with a specific block, identified by its hash. As part of the eth_getUncleCountByBlockHash RPC protocol, it provides a streamlined way to gather data about a block's uncles, which are essentially orphaned blocks that are not part of the main chain but are still recognized by the network. By using this method, developers can efficiently query uncle data, which is vital for understanding block validation and network performance. This method is indispensable for applications that require detailed blockchain analytics and insights.

## Common Errors

Common Errors  
When using the eth_getUncleCountByBlockHash JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:  
- Invalid block hash: Ensure that the block hash provided is a valid 32-byte hexadecimal string. Double-check for typos or incorrect formatting in the hash input.  
- Non-existent block hash: The block hash might not exist on the blockchain if it's from a future block or a fork. Verify that the block hash corresponds to a confirmed block within the blockchain.  
- Network connectivity issues: If there is a failure in the network connection to the BSC node, the request might not be processed. Ensure stable network connectivity and verify that the node is operational.  
- Incorrect JSON-RPC version: Ensure that the JSON-RPC version specified is "2.0" as required by the protocol. Using an incorrect version might lead to compatibility issues.
