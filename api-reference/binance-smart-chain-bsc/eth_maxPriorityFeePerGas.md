```
Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas

#### Request

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas",
  "params": [],
  "id": 1
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Response


```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "0x3b9aca00"
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas method:

1. `jsonrpc`: This parameter specifies the version of the JSON-RPC protocol. In this case, it is "2.0".

2. `id`: This is an identifier for the request. It is used to match the response with the request. In this example, the id is 1.

3. `result`: This parameter contains the result of the method call. For the eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas method, it returns the maximum priority fee per gas in hexadecimal format. In this example, the result is "0x3b9aca00".

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas method:

1. **Optimizing Transaction Costs**: In Ethereum, users pay gas fees to miners to process their transactions. The maxPriorityFeePerGas method helps developers determine the minimum priority fee that should be included in a transaction to ensure it is processed promptly. By using this method, developers can optimize transaction costs for users by suggesting a competitive priority fee that balances cost and speed, especially during periods of network congestion.

2. **Improving User Experience in DApps**: Decentralized applications (DApps) often require users to send transactions to the Ethereum network. By integrating the maxPriorityFeePerGas method, DApps can automatically suggest appropriate gas fees for users, enhancing the user experience by reducing the need for manual fee adjustments. This ensures that transactions are confirmed in a timely manner without excessive costs, making the DApp more user-friendly.

3. **Dynamic Fee Adjustment in Wallets**: Cryptocurrency wallets that support Ethereum can utilize the maxPriorityFeePerGas method to dynamically adjust transaction fees based on current network conditions. This method allows wallets to provide real-time fee recommendations, helping users avoid overpaying during low congestion periods or underpaying when the network is busy, thereby improving transaction success rates and efficiency.

### Code for eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "0x3b9aca00"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Common Errors

Common Errors  
When using the eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:  
- Network congestion may lead to outdated priority fee estimates. To mitigate this, ensure that your application dynamically adjusts to the latest network conditions.  
- Incorrectly formatted JSON-RPC requests can result in server errors. Double-check the structure and syntax of your requests to ensure compliance with JSON-RPC standards.  
- Insufficient permissions or incorrect API endpoint configuration might block access to the method. Verify that your node or service provider supports this method and that your credentials are properly configured.  
- Misinterpretation of the priority fee value can cause overpayment. Always validate the fee against current network activity and consider implementing a cap to avoid excessive fees.  

Using the eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas method in Web3 applications allows developers to optimize transaction costs by leveraging real-time network fee data. This enhances the efficiency of transaction processing and helps maintain cost-effectiveness, which is crucial for applications running on the BSC network.

### conclusion

The eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas method in the JSON-RPC API is crucial for determining the maximum priority fee per gas on the Ethereum network, ensuring efficient transaction processing. This feature is also relevant in similar blockchain environments like Binance Smart Chain (BSC), where understanding gas fees is essential for optimizing transaction costs.
