# eth\_syncing - BNB Smart Chain

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC eth\_syncing for BSC checks if the node is syncing with the network, providing synchronization status details.
{% endhint %}

The `eth_syncing` method in the BSC protocol is an essential JSON-RPC API call used to determine the synchronization status of a node. When invoked, `eth_syncing` Web3 provides information on whether the node is currently syncing with the network, returning either a boolean or detailed syncing data.

In the `eth_syncing` RPC protocol, if the node is syncing, it returns a structure with details like the starting block, current block, and highest block. This enables developers to monitor sync progress and ensure nodes are up-to-date, facilitating efficient network participation and data integrity.

### Supported Networks

The `eth_syncing` JSON-RPC API method supports the following network types:

* **Mainnet**
* **Testnet**

### Parameters

None: This method does not require any parameters.

## Request Example

**API Endpoint**

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```

**Request**

Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using `eth_syncing` :

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_syncing",
  "params": [],
  "id": 67
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Response**

Below is a sample JSON response returned by `eth_syncing` upon a successful call:

```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 67,
  "result": false
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for the `eth_syncing` method:

1. **jsonrpc**: The version of the JSON-RPC protocol, which is `"2.0"` in this case.
2. **id**: An identifier for the request, which is `67` in this example. It is used to match the response with the request.
3. **result**: The result of the `eth_syncing` method call. In this case, it is `false`, indicating that the Ethereum node is not currently syncing. If the node were syncing, this parameter would contain an object with details about the sync status.

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for the `eth_syncing` method:

1. **Node Synchronization Monitoring**: One of the primary use cases of the `eth_syncing` method is to monitor the synchronization status of an Ethereum node. When a node is syncing with the network, this method provides details about the current block, the highest block, and the starting block. Developers can use this information to determine when their node is fully synchronized and ready to process transactions and smart contracts.
2. **Network Health Check**: The `eth_syncing` method can also be used as part of a broader network health check strategy. By periodically checking the synchronization status of nodes, developers can ensure that their infrastructure is properly connected to the Ethereum network and operating efficiently. This is particularly useful for applications that require high availability and reliability, as it helps in identifying potential issues with node connectivity or performance.
3. **Automated Alerts and Notifications**: Another use case involves setting up automated alerts or notifications based on the synchronization status. For example, if a node falls behind in synchronization or encounters issues during the syncing process, the `eth_syncing` method can trigger alerts to notify developers or system administrators. This allows for timely intervention to resolve any issues and maintain the smooth operation of blockchain-based applications.

### Code for eth\_syncing

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_syncing",
  "params": [],
  "id": 67
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/";
const payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_syncing",
  "params": [],
  "id": 67
};

axios.post(url, payload, {
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
})
.then(response => {
  console.log("Result:", response.data.result);
})
.catch(error => {
  if (error.response) {
    console.error("Error:", error.response.status, error.response.data);
  } else {
    console.error("Request failed:", error.message);
  }
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Common Errors

When using the `eth_syncing` JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:

* The node might return false, indicating it is not syncing. Ensure your node is connected to a reliable peer network and verify that the blockchain data directory is not corrupted.
* The response may take longer than expected due to network congestion. Consider increasing your node's bandwidth or using a more powerful server to handle network traffic efficiently.
* Inconsistent syncing states can occur if the node configuration is incorrect. Double-check your node's configuration files for any discrepancies and ensure they align with the latest BSC network specifications.
* A node may fail to sync due to outdated software versions. Regularly update your node software to the latest version to maintain compatibility with the network's protocol changes.

Using the `eth_syncing` method in Web3 applications provides real-time insights into the synchronization status of your node, enabling developers to monitor and optimize node performance. This functionality is crucial for maintaining the reliability and efficiency of decentralized applications running on the BSC network.

### Conclusion

The `eth_syncing` method in JSON-RPC is a crucial component for monitoring the synchronization status of a node on Ethereum or BNB Smart Chain (BSC). By utilizing `eth_syncing`, developers can efficiently track the progress and ensure that their node is up-to-date with the network, thereby maintaining optimal performance and reliability.
