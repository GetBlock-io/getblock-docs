# eth_syncing

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC method checks if a Binance Smart Chain node is syncing, providing details on the current block and highest block being processed.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The eth_syncing Web3 method in the BSC protocol's JSON-RPC API provides users with real-time information about the syncing status of a node. When a node is in the process of synchronizing with the Binance Smart Chain network, this method returns an object with details such as the starting block, current block, and highest block. If the node is fully synchronized, it returns false. The eth_syncing RPC protocol is essential for developers and network participants who need to monitor node synchronization to ensure seamless interaction with the blockchain. By using this method, users can efficiently track the progress and status of their node's synchronization, facilitating better network management and operational planning.

### Supported Networks

The eth_syncing REST API method supports the following network types
- **Mainnet**
- **Testnets**

### Parameters

None: This method does not require any parameters.

### Request Example

#### API Endpoint

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```
Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using eth_syncing

#### Request

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_syncing",
  "params": [],
  "id": 67
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Response


```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 67,
  "result": false
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for eth_syncing method:

1. **jsonrpc**: The version of the JSON-RPC protocol. Typically, this is "2.0".
2. **id**: An identifier for the request, which can be used to match responses with requests.
3. **result**: The result of the method call. For the `eth_syncing` method, this is typically a boolean or an object. If it is `false`, it indicates that the node is not currently syncing. If it is an object, it contains details about the synchronization status, such as the starting block, current block, and highest block.

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for eth_syncing method in Web3 programming:

1. Monitoring Node Synchronization: Developers and network administrators can use this method to monitor the synchronization status of an Ethereum node. By checking whether the node is currently syncing and retrieving details about the sync progress, they can ensure that the node is up-to-date with the latest blocks and ready to process transactions and smart contracts efficiently.

2. Network Health Checks: This method can be employed as part of a broader strategy to assess the health of the Ethereum network. By collecting sync status data from multiple nodes, developers can gain insights into network performance, identify potential bottlenecks, and ensure that the network is functioning smoothly.

3. Conditional Logic in DApps: Decentralized application (DApp) developers can use the synchronization status to implement conditional logic within their applications. For example, a DApp might restrict certain functionalities or display warnings if the underlying node is not fully synced, thereby preventing users from making decisions based on outdated blockchain data.

### Code for eth_syncing

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 67,
  "result": false
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Common Errors

Common Errors  
When using the eth_syncing JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:  
- Incorrect Node Configuration: If your node is not configured correctly, it may not sync properly. Ensure your node is set up with the correct network settings and has sufficient resources to handle the sync process.  
- Network Latency: High network latency can cause delays in synchronization. To mitigate this, consider optimizing your network connection or using a node closer to your geographical location.  
- Outdated Client Software: Using an outdated client version can lead to compatibility issues. Regularly update your client software to the latest version to ensure smooth operation.  
- Insufficient Disk Space: Syncing requires significant disk space, and running out can halt the process. Monitor your disk usage and allocate additional storage as needed to accommodate the blockchain data.  

The eth_syncing method is essential in Web3 applications as it allows developers to monitor the synchronization status of a node, ensuring that it is up-to-date with the latest state of the blockchain. This functionality is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of decentralized applications that rely on real-time blockchain data.

### conclusion

The eth_syncing JSON-RPC method is crucial for checking the synchronization status of a blockchain node, such as those on the Ethereum network or Binance Smart Chain (BSC). By utilizing this method, developers can determine whether their node is fully synced with the network, ensuring accurate data retrieval and transaction processing. Understanding the synchronization state through eth_syncing is vital for maintaining the reliability and performance of applications built on blockchain platforms like BSC.
