# eth_uninstallFilter

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC method removes a filter on Binance Smart Chain, stopping event notifications and freeing up resources.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The eth_uninstallFilter Web3 method is a crucial tool for developers working with the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) protocol. It allows the removal of filters that were previously created using the eth_newFilter method. By using the eth_uninstallFilter RPC protocol, developers can efficiently manage and free up resources by eliminating unnecessary filters. This method requires the filter ID as a parameter, ensuring precise and effective filter management. When a filter is no longer needed, invoking this method helps maintain optimal performance and resource allocation within your application. It's an essential function for developers aiming to maintain streamlined and efficient blockchain interactions on the BSC network.

### Supported Networks

The eth_uninstallFilter REST API method supports the following network types
- **Mainnet**
- **Testnets**

### Parameters

Here is the list of parameters eth_uninstallFilter method needs to be executed.

- **Filter ID**: 
  - **Type**: String
  - **Description**: The ID of the filter to be uninstalled.
  - **Required**: Yes
  - **Default/Supported Values**: A valid filter ID, typically represented as a hexadecimal string (e.g., "0x10ff0bfba9472c87932c56632eef8f5cc70910e8e71d").

### Request Example

#### API Endpoint

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```
Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using eth_uninstallFilter

#### Request

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_uninstallFilter",
  "params": ["0x10ff0bfba9472c87932c56632eef8f5cc70910e8e71d"],
  "id": 1
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Response


```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": false
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for eth_uninstallFilter method:

1. `jsonrpc`: A string specifying the version of the JSON-RPC protocol. Typically, this is "2.0".
2. `id`: An identifier for the request. It is used to match the response with the request that it corresponds to. In this case, it is `1`.
3. `result`: A boolean value indicating the success or failure of the method. In this example, it is `false`, meaning the filter was not successfully uninstalled.

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for eth_uninstallFilter method:

1. **Resource Management**: In Web3 programming, filters are used to listen for specific events or changes on the Ethereum blockchain. Over time, a large number of active filters can consume unnecessary resources and degrade performance. By using this method, developers can efficiently manage resources by removing filters that are no longer needed, ensuring the application runs smoothly and efficiently.

2. **Event Subscription Cleanup**: When a decentralized application (dApp) needs to stop listening for certain events, perhaps due to a change in user state or application logic, this method is useful. It allows developers to clean up event subscriptions by uninstalling filters that are no longer relevant, preventing the application from processing irrelevant data and reducing network traffic.

3. **Security and Privacy**: In some scenarios, maintaining active filters might inadvertently expose sensitive information or lead to privacy concerns. By uninstalling filters that are no longer necessary, developers can enhance the security and privacy of their dApp, ensuring that only essential data is being monitored and processed.

### Code for eth_uninstallFilter

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": false
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Common Errors

Common Errors  
When using the eth_uninstallFilter JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:  
- Invalid filter ID: If the filter ID provided does not exist or has already been uninstalled, the method will return false. Verify the filter ID before attempting to uninstall it.  
- Network connectivity issues: If there is a problem with the network connection to the BSC node, the request may fail. Ensure that your network connection is stable and the node is accessible.  
- Rate limiting: Excessive requests to uninstall filters may trigger rate limiting on some nodes. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff to handle such scenarios gracefully.  
- Incorrect JSON-RPC version: Using an incompatible JSON-RPC version can lead to unexpected errors. Ensure you are using the correct version that supports the eth_uninstallFilter method.

Using the eth_uninstallFilter method in Web3 applications is beneficial as it helps manage resources effectively by removing unnecessary filters, reducing memory usage on the node. This contributes to improved application performance and network efficiency by preventing the accumulation of unused filters.

### conclusion

The eth_uninstallFilter method in JSON-RPC is used to remove a filter that was previously created on the Ethereum network or Binance Smart Chain (BSC). By uninstalling a filter, clients can stop receiving updates or logs associated with that filter, which helps in managing resources efficiently. This method is crucial for developers to ensure that their applications do not consume unnecessary bandwidth or processing power on Ethereum or BSC networks.
