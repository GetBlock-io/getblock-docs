# eth_uninstallFilter

{% hint style="success" %}
The method removes a previously created filter on Binance Smart Chain, freeing up resources and stopping event notifications.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The `eth_uninstallFilter` method in the BSC protocol is a JSON-RPC API call used to remove a filter created with `eth_newFilter`, `eth_newBlockFilter`, or `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter`. This method helps manage and optimize resource usage by eliminating unnecessary filters. When invoked, it returns a boolean indicating the success of the operation.

In the context of Web3 and the `eth_uninstallFilter` RPC protocol, this method is essential for maintaining efficient network performance by allowing clients to clean up filters that are no longer needed. Proper use of this method ensures that applications using Web3 can manage their subscriptions effectively, preventing potential resource leaks or performance issues.

## Supported Networks

The eth_uninstallFilter JSON-RPC API method supports the following network types:
- **Mainnet**
- **Testnet**

## Parameters

Here is the list of parameters `eth_uninstallFilter` method needs to be executed. Always format the method name as inline code (wrapped in backticks).

- **Parameter**: `filterId`
  - **Type**: String
  - **Description**: The identifier of the filter to be uninstalled. This ID is returned by previous filter creation methods like `eth_newFilter` or `eth_newBlockFilter`.
  - **Required**: Yes
  - **Default/Supported Values**: Must be a valid filter ID, typically a hexadecimal string starting with "0x".

# Request Example

##### API Endpoint

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```


#### Request

Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using eth_uninstallFilter :

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_uninstallFilter",
  "params": ["0x10ff0bfba9472c87932c56632eef8f5cc70910e8e71d"],
  "id": 1
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Response

Below is a sample JSON response returned by eth_uninstallFilter upon a successful call:

```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": false
}

```

## Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for the `eth_uninstallFilter` method:

1. **jsonrpc**: The version of the JSON-RPC protocol. In this case, it is `"2.0"`.
2. **id**: A unique identifier for the request, which helps to match the response with the request. In this example, the ID is `1`.
3. **result**: A boolean value indicating whether the filter was successfully uninstalled. In this example, the result is `false`, meaning the filter was not successfully uninstalled.

## Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for `eth_uninstallFilter` method:

1. **Resource Management**: In Web3 programming, filters are used to listen for specific events or changes on the Ethereum blockchain. Each filter consumes resources on the Ethereum client. By using the `eth_uninstallFilter` method, developers can efficiently manage these resources by removing filters that are no longer needed, thus ensuring that the application does not waste bandwidth or processing power on unnecessary data.

2. **Event Listening Optimization**: When an application needs to switch from one event listener to another, `eth_uninstallFilter` can be used to stop listening to the current filter before setting a new one. This helps in optimizing the event listening process, ensuring that the application only listens for relevant events and reduces the chances of processing redundant or outdated information.

3. **Security and Data Integrity**: In scenarios where filters are dynamically created based on user input or certain conditions, it is essential to remove these filters when they are no longer valid or needed. Using `eth_uninstallFilter` helps maintain data integrity and security by ensuring that sensitive or unnecessary filters are not left active, which could lead to unwanted data leaks or processing of irrelevant events.

## Code for eth_uninstallFilter

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": false
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/";
const payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": false
};

axios.post(url, payload, {
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
})
.then(response => {
  console.log("Result:", response.data.result);
})
.catch(error => {
  if (error.response) {
    console.error("Error:", error.response.status, error.response.data);
  } else {
    console.error("Request failed:", error.message);
  }
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Common Errors

When using the `eth_uninstallFilter` JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:
- **Invalid Filter ID**: If the filter ID provided is incorrect or has already been uninstalled, the method will return `false`. Ensure that the filter ID is valid and currently active before attempting to uninstall it.
- **Network Latency**: High network latency can cause delays in the uninstallation process, leading to timeouts. To mitigate this, ensure a stable network connection and consider increasing the timeout settings for your RPC client.
- **Node Synchronization Issues**: If the BSC node is not fully synchronized, it may fail to process the filter uninstallation request properly. Verify that the node is fully synced and operational before making the request.

Using the `eth_uninstallFilter` method in Web3 applications is beneficial as it helps in managing resources efficiently by removing unnecessary filters that are no longer in use. This not only optimizes the application's performance but also reduces the load on the network node, ensuring a more responsive and scalable decentralized application environment.

## Conclusion

The `eth_uninstallFilter` method in JSON-RPC is used to remove a filter that was previously created, such as those used for monitoring events or changes on the Ethereum blockchain or Binance Smart Chain (BSC). By uninstalling a filter using `eth_uninstallFilter`, resources are freed up, ensuring that the client does not continue to receive unnecessary updates. This method is crucial for maintaining efficient communication and resource management within applications interacting with blockchain networks like Ethereum and BSC.
