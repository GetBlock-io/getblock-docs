# net_listening

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC method checks if the Binance Smart Chain node is actively listening for network connections, ensuring it can communicate with other nodes.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The net_listening Web3 method is an essential component of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network, utilized to determine if a node is actively listening for incoming network connections. As part of the net_listening RPC protocol, this method returns a Boolean value: true if the node is listening, indicating it's ready to accept connections, or false if it is not. This functionality is crucial for developers and network administrators to monitor and manage node connectivity effectively. By integrating net_listening within the JSON-RPC API Interface, users can programmatically check the network status of their BSC nodes, ensuring seamless communication and network reliability. This method is a vital tool for maintaining robust blockchain infrastructure and optimizing node performance.

### Supported Networks

The net_listening REST API method supports the following network types
- **Mainnet**
- **Testnets**

### Parameters

None: This method does not require any parameters.

### Request Example

#### API Endpoint

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```
Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using net_listening

#### Request

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "net_listening",
  "params": [],
  "id": 67
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Response


```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 67,
  "result": true
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for net_listening method:

1. **jsonrpc**: A string specifying the version of the JSON-RPC protocol, typically "2.0".
2. **id**: A unique identifier for the request, which in this case is 67.
3. **result**: A boolean value indicating the outcome of the request. In this example, it is `true`, meaning the network is listening.

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for net_listening method in Web3 programming:

1. **Network Connectivity Monitoring**: Developers can use this method to check if a node is currently listening for network connections. This is crucial for ensuring that the node is properly set up and capable of interacting with other nodes on the blockchain network. By confirming that the node is listening, developers can verify that their application is ready to send and receive data over the network.

2. **Troubleshooting and Diagnostics**: When encountering connectivity issues, this method can help diagnose whether a node is actively participating in the network. If a node is not listening, it could indicate configuration issues or network problems. By incorporating this method into diagnostic tools, developers can quickly identify and address connectivity problems, ensuring smoother operation of decentralized applications.

3. **Node Status Verification**: In a decentralized application, ensuring that all nodes are functioning correctly is essential for maintaining network reliability and performance. This method can be used as part of a regular status check routine to verify that nodes are listening as expected. This ongoing verification helps maintain network health and can alert developers to potential issues before they impact the application's functionality.

### Code for net_listening

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 67,
  "result": true
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Common Errors

Common Errors  
When using the net_listening JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:  
- Network connectivity issues may prevent the node from listening. Ensure that your network settings are correctly configured and that no firewall rules are blocking the necessary ports.  
- If the node is not fully synchronized with the network, the method might return false. Verify that your node is up-to-date and fully synced with the BSC network.  
- Invalid JSON-RPC request format can lead to errors. Double-check that your JSON structure adheres to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification and that all required fields are correctly populated.  
- Permission issues might restrict access to the net_listening method if the node's configuration is too restrictive. Review the node's access control settings to ensure that the method is accessible.

Using the net_listening method in Web3 applications provides a reliable way to check if a BSC node is actively listening for network connections, which is crucial for maintaining real-time interaction with the blockchain. This functionality helps developers ensure that their applications are connected to the network, facilitating seamless transactions and data retrieval.

### conclusion

The net_listening method in JSON-RPC is crucial for determining if a node is actively listening for network connections, which is essential for maintaining connectivity within a blockchain network like Binance Smart Chain (BSC). By using net_listening, developers can ensure their BSC nodes are properly configured and operational, facilitating seamless communication and transaction processing across the network. This method plays a vital role in network diagnostics and health monitoring for blockchain infrastructures.
