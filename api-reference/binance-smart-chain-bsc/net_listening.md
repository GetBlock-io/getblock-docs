# net\_listening - Binance Smart Chain

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC method checks if a Binance Smart Chain node is actively listening for network connections, indicating its readiness to participate in the network.
{% endhint %}

The `net_listening` method in the BSC protocol is a key component of the `net_listening` Web3 interface. It checks if the client is actively listening for network connections, returning a boolean. This method is crucial for applications to verify network connectivity and ensure seamless interaction with the blockchain.

Through the `net_listening` RPC protocol, developers can programmatically determine the node's listening status. This facilitates better network management and troubleshooting, providing a straightforward mechanism to confirm that the node is ready to accept incoming connections.

### Supported Networks

The `net_listening` JSON-RPC API method supports the following network types:

* **Mainnet**
* **Testnet**

### Parameters

None: This method does not require any parameters.

## Request Example

**API Endpoint**

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```

**Request**

Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using `net_listening` :

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "net_listening",
  "params": [],
  "id": 67
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Response**

Below is a sample JSON response returned by `net_listening` upon a successful call:

```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 67,
  "result": true
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for `net_listening` method:

1. **jsonrpc**: The version of the JSON-RPC protocol, typically "2.0".
2. **id**: A unique identifier for the request, which helps in matching responses to requests. In this case, it is 67.
3. **result**: A boolean value indicating whether the node is actively listening for network connections. In the given response, it is `true`.

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for `net_listening` method:

1. **Network Status Monitoring**: The `net_listening` method can be used to check if a node is actively listening for network connections. This is particularly useful for developers and network administrators who need to ensure that their Ethereum node is properly connected to the network and ready to accept incoming connections. By regularly checking the listening status, they can quickly identify and troubleshoot connectivity issues.
2. **Automated Health Checks**: In a production environment, automated scripts or monitoring tools can utilize the `net_listening` method to perform regular health checks on Ethereum nodes. By integrating this method into automated monitoring systems, developers can receive alerts if a node stops listening, allowing for prompt intervention to maintain optimal network performance and uptime.
3. **Load Balancing and Failover**: For applications that rely on multiple Ethereum nodes, the `net_listening` method can be used to implement load balancing and failover strategies. By checking which nodes are currently listening, applications can dynamically route traffic to available nodes, ensuring efficient load distribution and minimizing downtime in case of node failures.

### Code for net\_listening

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "net_listening",
  "params": [],
  "id": 67
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/";
const payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "net_listening",
  "params": [],
  "id": 67
};

axios.post(url, payload, {
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
})
.then(response => {
  console.log("Result:", response.data.result);
})
.catch(error => {
  if (error.response) {
    console.error("Error:", error.response.status, error.response.data);
  } else {
    console.error("Request failed:", error.message);
  }
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Common Errors

When using the `net_listening` JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:

* Network connectivity issues: If the node is not properly connected to the network, `net_listening` may return false. Ensure that your node is correctly configured and has stable internet connectivity.
* Incorrect node configuration: If the node is not set up to listen for network connections, the method will fail. Verify that the node's configuration file allows for incoming connections and that no firewall rules are blocking access.
* RPC endpoint issues: If the RPC endpoint is not correctly set up or is unavailable, you may receive an error. Check the RPC server status and ensure that the endpoint URL is correctly specified in your application.
* Authentication errors: If your RPC server requires authentication and the credentials are incorrect or missing, the method may not execute. Double-check your authentication settings and credentials.

Using the `net_listening` method in Web3 applications is beneficial as it allows developers to programmatically check if a node is actively listening for network connections, ensuring that the node is operational and ready to participate in the blockchain network. This functionality is crucial for maintaining robust and reliable decentralized applications by enabling automated health checks and network status monitoring.

### Conclusion

The `net_listening` method in JSON-RPC is a crucial tool for determining if a node is actively listening for network connections, which is essential for maintaining robust communication in blockchain networks like BSC (Binance Smart Chain). By using `net_listening`, developers can ensure their nodes are correctly configured and ready to participate in the network, thereby enhancing the overall reliability and performance of the BSC ecosystem.
