# net_peerCount

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC method for BSC returns the number of connected peers, helping assess network connectivity and node health.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The net_peerCount Web3 method is a crucial component of the BSC network, utilized for retrieving the number of connected peers. This method, accessible through the net_peerCount RPC protocol, provides developers and network administrators with real-time data on network connectivity, which is essential for monitoring network health and performance. By returning the count of active peer connections, it helps in assessing network robustness and detecting potential connectivity issues. To use this method, simply invoke it via the JSON-RPC API Interface, and it will return a hexadecimal string representing the peer count. This information is vital for maintaining optimal network operations and ensuring that nodes are effectively communicating within the BSC network environment.

### Supported Networks

The net_peerCount REST API method supports the following network types
- **Mainnet**
- **Testnets**

### Parameters

None: This method does not require any parameters.

### Request Example

#### API Endpoint

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```
Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using net_peerCount

#### Request

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "net_peerCount",
  "params": [],
  "id": 67
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Response


```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 67,
  "result": "0x42"
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for net_peerCount method:

1. **jsonrpc**: The version of the JSON-RPC protocol, which is "2.0" in this case.
2. **id**: A unique identifier for the request, which is "67" in this case.
3. **result**: The result of the method call, which is the hexadecimal representation of the peer count, "0x42" in this case.

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for net_peerCount method:

1. Monitoring Network Health: In a blockchain network, the number of connected peers can be an indicator of network health. By using this method, developers can monitor the number of peers their node is connected to. A sudden drop in peer count might indicate network issues or connectivity problems, prompting further investigation or corrective actions.

2. Optimizing Node Performance: For developers managing blockchain nodes, understanding the peer count can help optimize node performance. A high number of peers can lead to increased network traffic and resource consumption. By monitoring peer count, developers can adjust node configurations to maintain a balance between connectivity and performance, ensuring efficient operation.

3. Security and Anomaly Detection: The peer count can also be used as a metric for detecting unusual activity or potential security threats. An unexpected increase or decrease in peer count could signify a potential attack or misconfiguration. By regularly checking the peer count, developers can quickly identify and respond to anomalies, enhancing the security of their blockchain network.

### Code for net_peerCount

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 67,
  "result": "0x42"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Common Errors

Common Errors  
When using the net_peerCount JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:  
- Network latency or connectivity issues can lead to timeouts when attempting to call the method. Ensure your network connection is stable and consider increasing the timeout setting in your client configuration.  
- Incorrect node configuration may result in the method returning inaccurate peer counts. Verify that your node is fully synchronized and correctly configured to connect to the BSC network.  
- Authentication errors can occur if your node requires credentials and they are not provided or are incorrect. Double-check your authentication setup and ensure credentials are correctly supplied in your RPC client.  

Using the net_peerCount method in Web3 applications provides valuable insights into the connectivity and health of your BSC node by returning the number of peers connected to it. This information can be crucial for monitoring network stability and ensuring optimal performance of decentralized applications.

### conclusion

The net_peerCount method in JSON-RPC is an essential tool for querying the number of active peers connected to a BSC (Binance Smart Chain) node. By utilizing net_peerCount, developers and network administrators can monitor and manage network connectivity effectively. This function is crucial for ensuring optimal performance and stability of the BSC network.
