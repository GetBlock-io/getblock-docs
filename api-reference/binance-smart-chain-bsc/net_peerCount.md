# net\_peerCount - Binance Smart Chain

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC method returns the number of connected peers to a BSC node, helping monitor network connectivity and node performance.
{% endhint %}

The `net_peerCount` method in the BSC protocol is a JSON-RPC API call used to determine the number of peers currently connected to a node. As part of the `net_peerCount` Web3 interface, it provides essential network status information, aiding developers in monitoring and managing node connectivity efficiently.

Utilizing the `net_peerCount` RPC protocol, this method returns a hexadecimal string representing the count of active peer connections. This data is crucial for ensuring optimal network performance and troubleshooting connection issues. By integrating `net_peerCount`, developers can enhance their application's reliability and responsiveness within the BSC ecosystem.

### Supported Networks

The `net_peerCount` JSON-RPC API method supports the following network types:

* **Mainnet**
* **Testnet**

### Parameters

None: This method does not require any parameters.

## Request Example

**API Endpoint**

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```

**Request**

Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using `net_peerCount` :

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "net_peerCount",
  "params": [],
  "id": 67
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Response**

Below is a sample JSON response returned by `net_peerCount` upon a successful call:

```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 67,
  "result": "0x42"
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for `net_peerCount` method:

1. **`jsonrpc`**: This field specifies the version of the JSON-RPC protocol. It is typically set to "2.0".
2. **`id`**: This is an identifier for the request. It can be any number or string that the client uses to match the response with the request.
3. **`result`**: This field contains the result of the `net_peerCount` method call. The result is typically a hexadecimal string representing the number of peers connected to the network. In this case, "0x42" indicates that there are 66 peers connected.

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for `net_peerCount` method:

1. **Network Health Monitoring**: The `net_peerCount` method is used to monitor the health and connectivity of a blockchain node within a network. By retrieving the number of peers connected to a node, developers and network administrators can assess whether the node is maintaining sufficient connections to ensure reliable participation in the network. A low peer count might indicate network issues or misconfigurations that need to be addressed to maintain optimal performance.
2. **Load Balancing and Resource Allocation**: In a distributed application, understanding the peer count can help in load balancing and resource allocation. By knowing how many peers a node is connected to, developers can make informed decisions about distributing network traffic or deploying additional nodes to handle increased loads, ensuring that the application remains responsive and efficient.
3. **Security and Anomaly Detection**: The `net_peerCount` method can be used as part of a security strategy to detect anomalies or potential attacks. A sudden drop or spike in peer count might indicate a network partition, DDoS attack, or other malicious activity. By regularly monitoring peer count, developers can quickly identify and respond to suspicious behavior, enhancing the security and resilience of the network.

### Code for net\_peerCount

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "net_peerCount",
  "params": [],
  "id": 67
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/";
const payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "net_peerCount",
  "params": [],
  "id": 67
};

axios.post(url, payload, {
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
})
.then(response => {
  console.log("Result:", response.data.result);
})
.catch(error => {
  if (error.response) {
    console.error("Error:", error.response.status, error.response.data);
  } else {
    console.error("Request failed:", error.message);
  }
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Common Errors

When using the `net_peerCount` JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:

* **Network Latency:** High network latency can result in delayed responses from the `net_peerCount` method. Ensure your network connection is stable and consider increasing the timeout settings in your client configuration.
* **Node Synchronization Issues:** If the node is not fully synchronized with the BSC network, the `net_peerCount` method might return inaccurate peer counts. Verify that your node is fully synced by checking its block height against the current network block height.
* **Incorrect Node Configuration:** Misconfigured nodes can lead to incorrect peer count data. Double-check your node's configuration files to ensure all parameters are set correctly according to BSC network specifications.
* **RPC Endpoint Unavailability:** The `net_peerCount` call might fail if the RPC endpoint is down or unreachable. Verify the availability of the RPC endpoint and consider using a backup endpoint if necessary.

Using the `net_peerCount` method in Web3 applications provides valuable insights into the network connectivity status of a BSC node, allowing developers to monitor and optimize node performance. By tracking peer count, developers can ensure their nodes are well-connected, enhancing the reliability and efficiency of their decentralized applications.

### Conclusion

The `net_peerCount` method in JSON-RPC is a crucial tool for monitoring the number of connected peers in a blockchain network, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC). By providing real-time insights into network connectivity, `net_peerCount` helps ensure optimal performance and stability in BSC environments.
