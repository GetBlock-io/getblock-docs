# net_version

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC net_version for BSC returns the current network ID, helping applications identify which blockchain network they are interacting with.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The net_version Web3 method in the BSC protocol's JSON-RPC API Interface is a key tool for developers seeking to identify the network ID of the Binance Smart Chain they are interacting with. By calling this method, users can retrieve a string that represents the current network version, facilitating compatibility checks and ensuring that applications are operating on the intended blockchain network. The net_version RPC protocol is crucial for applications that need to dynamically adapt to different network environments, such as mainnet, testnet, or any private networks. This method provides a straightforward way to verify network configurations, aiding in the development of robust, cross-network applications.

### Supported Networks

The net_version REST API method supports the following network types
- **Mainnet**
- **Testnets**

### Parameters

None: This method does not require any parameters.

### Request Example

#### API Endpoint

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```
Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using net_version

#### Request

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "net_version",
  "params": [],
  "id": 67
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Response


```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 67,
  "result": "56"
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for net_version method:

1. **jsonrpc**: The version of the JSON-RPC protocol, typically "2.0".
2. **id**: A unique identifier for the request, used to match responses to requests. In this case, it is 67.
3. **result**: The version of the network as a string. In this example, it is "56".

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for net_version method in Web3 programming:

1. Network Identification: In Web3 applications, it's crucial to know which Ethereum network you are interacting with, such as the mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby, or any other test network. The net_version method helps developers identify the network by returning its unique network ID. This ensures that the application behaves appropriately depending on the network, preventing issues such as deploying contracts to the wrong network or using incorrect configurations.

2. Conditional Logic Based on Network: Developers often need to implement conditional logic in their applications based on the network they are connected to. By using the net_version method, they can fetch the network ID and execute different code paths. For example, an application might connect to different APIs, use different contract addresses, or enable specific features only on certain networks.

3. Debugging and Development: During the development and debugging phases, it's essential to ensure that the application is connected to the correct network. The net_version method can be used in logging and debugging processes to verify network connections. This can help developers quickly identify configuration errors or mismatches between the intended and actual networks being used.

### Code for net_version

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 67,
  "result": "56"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Common Errors

Common Errors  
When using the net_version JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:  
- Network ID mismatch: If the network ID returned does not match the expected value, ensure that your node is connected to the correct blockchain network and verify the node configuration.  
- Connection timeout: This error occurs when the request to the node takes too long to respond. Check your network connection and node status to ensure it is running and accessible.  
- Invalid response format: If the response is not in the expected JSON format, verify that the node is running the correct software version and that there are no network issues affecting data transmission.  
- Unauthorized access: If you encounter a permissions error, ensure that your API credentials are correctly configured and that your node allows access from your client.  

Using the net_version method in Web3 applications is beneficial as it provides a quick and reliable way to verify the network your application is connected to, ensuring compatibility and preventing cross-network issues. This functionality is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of transactions and interactions within decentralized applications.

### conclusion

The net_version method in a JSON-RPC call is used to retrieve the current network version of a blockchain like BSC. This is crucial for ensuring compatibility and understanding the specific network environment in which transactions and smart contracts are executed. By using net_version in JSON-RPC, developers can seamlessly interact with the BSC network and manage blockchain operations effectively.
