# net\_version - BNB Smart Chain

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC net\_version for BSC returns the current network ID, helping to identify the specific blockchain network being interacted with.
{% endhint %}

The `net_version` method in the BSC protocol is a JSON-RPC API call used to retrieve the current network ID. This is essential for applications to confirm they are interacting with the correct blockchain network. By calling `net_version`, developers can ensure compatibility and prevent cross-network issues.

In the context of Web3, `net_version` is crucial for dApps to verify network integrity. The method adheres to the JSON-RPC protocol, a lightweight remote procedure call protocol, ensuring efficient communication between client applications and the BSC network. This enhances the reliability and security of blockchain interactions.

### Supported Networks

The `net_version` JSON-RPC API method supports the following network types:

* **Mainnet**
* **Testnet**

### Parameters

None: This method does not require any parameters.

## Request Example

**API Endpoint**

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```

**Request**

Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using `net_version` :

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "net_version",
  "params": [],
  "id": 67
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Response**

Below is a sample JSON response returned by `net_version`upon a successful call:

```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 67,
  "result": "56"
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for `net_version` method:

1. **jsonrpc**: The version of the JSON-RPC protocol being used. In this case, it is "2.0".
2. **id**: A unique identifier for the request. Here, it is set to 67.
3. **result**: The network version as a string. In this example, the result is "56".

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for `net_version` method:

1. **Network Identification**: In Web3 programming, the `net_version` method is used to identify the network on which a node is currently operating. This is crucial when developing decentralized applications (dApps) that need to interact with different Ethereum networks, such as the mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby, or any private network. By calling `net_version`, developers can ensure that their application is connected to the correct network, preventing potential issues with transactions or contract interactions.
2. **Environment Configuration**: Developers often use `net_version` to configure their application environment dynamically. For example, based on the network ID returned by `net_version`, a dApp can automatically select the appropriate smart contract addresses, APIs, or other network-specific configurations. This helps in maintaining a single codebase that can adapt to multiple environments without manual intervention.
3. **User Feedback and Debugging**: Providing users with feedback about the current network can enhance user experience and aid in debugging. By utilizing the `net_version` method, a dApp can display the current network to the user, helping them understand where their transactions are being processed. Additionally, developers can use this information to log network activity and diagnose issues related to network misconfigurations.

### Code for net\_version

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "net_version",
  "params": [],
  "id": 67
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/";
const payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "net_version",
  "params": [],
  "id": 67
};

axios.post(url, payload, {
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
})
.then(response => {
  console.log("Result:", response.data.result);
})
.catch(error => {
  if (error.response) {
    console.error("Error:", error.response.status, error.response.data);
  } else {
    console.error("Request failed:", error.message);
  }
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Common Errors

When using the `net_version` JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:

* Network ID Mismatch: If the returned network ID does not match the expected value for BNB Smart Chain, ensure that your endpoint is correctly configured and pointing to a BSC node. Verify your connection settings and node provider.
* Timeout Errors: If the request times out, this might be due to network latency or server overload. Try increasing the timeout setting in your client library or switch to a more reliable node provider.
* Unauthorized Access: If you receive an authorization error, check your API key and permissions. Make sure your credentials are correctly set up and have the necessary permissions to access the network information.
* Invalid Response Format: If the response from the server is not in the expected JSON format, verify that you are communicating with a compliant BSC node and that there are no middleware issues altering the response.

Using the `net_version` method in Web3 applications is beneficial as it allows developers to programmatically verify the network their application is connected to, ensuring compatibility and preventing cross-network transaction issues. This method helps maintain the integrity of decentralized applications by confirming the correct blockchain environment.

### Conclusion

The `net_version` method in JSON-RPC is used to retrieve the current network ID, which is essential for applications interacting with blockchain networks like BSC. By calling `net_version`, developers can ensure compatibility and proper network identification, facilitating seamless integration with BSC and other blockchain environments.
