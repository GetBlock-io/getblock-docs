---

# web3_clientVersion

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC method retrieves the client version of a BSC node, providing details about the software version and network compatibility.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The web3_clientVersion Web3 method is an integral part of the JSON-RPC API Interface, specifically designed for the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) protocol. This method allows users to obtain the current version details of the client software they are interacting with. By utilizing the web3_clientVersion RPC protocol, developers can ensure compatibility and troubleshoot issues by identifying the exact client version in use. This method returns a string containing the version information, which is essential for maintaining up-to-date applications and ensuring seamless integration with the BSC network. Its straightforward implementation and reliable output make it a valuable tool for developers seeking to optimize their blockchain interactions.

### Supported Networks

The web3_clientVersion REST API method supports the following network types
- **Mainnet**
- **Testnets**

### Parameters

None: This method does not require any parameters.

### Request Example

#### API Endpoint

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```
Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using web3_clientVersion

#### Request

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "web3_clientVersion",
  "params": [],
  "id": 1
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Response


```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "Geth/v1.5.8-294c7321-20250323/linux-amd64/go1.24.0"
}

```

### Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for web3_clientVersion method:

1. **jsonrpc**: This parameter specifies the version of the JSON-RPC protocol being used. In this case, it is "2.0".

2. **id**: This is an identifier for the request, which can be used to match responses with requests. Here, the id is 1.

3. **result**: This parameter contains the actual response from the client, providing the version information of the Ethereum client. In this example, it is "Geth/v1.5.8-294c7321-20250323/linux-amd64/go1.24.0", which indicates the client software (Geth), version (v1.5.8), commit hash (294c7321), build date (20250323), operating system (linux), architecture (amd64), and Go version (go1.24.0).

### Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for web3_clientVersion method:

1. **Client Compatibility Checks**: When developing decentralized applications (dApps), it's important to ensure that the application is compatible with the user's Ethereum client. By using this method, developers can retrieve the client version information, allowing them to tailor their application to specific client capabilities and versions. This helps in providing a seamless user experience and avoiding potential compatibility issues.

2. **Network Diagnostics and Debugging**: In the process of diagnosing network issues or debugging a decentralized application, knowing the client version can be crucial. This method allows developers to gather information about the client software being used, which can help in identifying discrepancies or bugs that are specific to certain client versions. This is particularly useful in environments where multiple clients with different implementations are in use.

3. **Analytics and User Insights**: For developers and project managers, understanding the distribution of client versions used by their application's user base can provide valuable insights. By collecting client version data, they can analyze trends, such as which clients are most popular or if there's a need to support older versions. This information can inform future development priorities and resource allocation.

### Code for web3_clientVersion

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "Geth/v1.5.8-294c7321-20250323/linux-amd64/go1.24.0"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Common Errors

Common Errors  
When using the web3_clientVersion JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:  
- Network connectivity issues: If the client cannot connect to the BSC node, ensure that the network configuration is correct and the node is running. Check firewall settings and network proxies that might block the connection.  
- Incorrect endpoint URL: If the endpoint URL is incorrect, the request will fail. Verify that the URL is correctly formatted and points to a valid BSC node.  
- Invalid JSON format: Sending a malformed JSON request can lead to errors. Double-check the JSON structure for syntax errors or missing fields.  
- Unsupported client version: If the client version is not supported by the node, you may encounter compatibility issues. Ensure your client software is up-to-date and compatible with the BSC node version.  

Using the web3_clientVersion method in Web3 applications provides valuable information about the client and the network it is connected to. This can help developers ensure compatibility and troubleshoot issues more effectively. By confirming the client version, developers can maintain consistent and reliable interactions with the BSC network.

### conclusion

The web3_clientVersion method in JSON-RPC is used to retrieve the client version of the connected node, such as on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). This is essential for ensuring compatibility and understanding the capabilities of the blockchain environment you are interacting with. By using web3_clientVersion, developers can effectively manage and optimize their interactions with BSC nodes.
