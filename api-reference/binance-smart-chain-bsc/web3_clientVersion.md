# web3_clientVersion

{% hint style="success" %}
The RPC web3_clientVersion for BSC retrieves the client software version, providing information about the node's software and version details.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The `web3_clientVersion` method in the BSC protocol provides a way to retrieve the current client version using the `web3_clientVersion Web3` interface. This method is part of the JSON-RPC API, allowing clients to query the version of the node they are interacting with, ensuring compatibility and aiding in debugging.

Utilizing the `web3_clientVersion RPC protocol`, users can execute a simple request to obtain a string response that details the client name and version number. This is essential for developers who need to verify the software version being used, facilitating smoother integration and maintenance of blockchain applications.

## Supported Networks

The web3_clientVersion JSON-RPC API method supports the following network types:
- **Mainnet**
- **Testnet**

## Parameters

None: This method does not require any parameters.

# Request Example

##### API Endpoint

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```


#### Request

Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using web3_clientVersion :

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location --request POST https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data-raw {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "web3_clientVersion",
  "params": [],
  "id": 1
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Response

Below is a sample JSON response returned by web3_clientVersion upon a successful call:

```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "Geth/v1.5.8-294c7321-20250323/linux-amd64/go1.24.0"
}

```

## Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for `web3_clientVersion` method:

1. **jsonrpc**: The version of the JSON-RPC protocol used, which is "2.0" in this response.
2. **id**: A unique identifier for the request, which is 1 in this response.
3. **result**: The client version string returned by the Ethereum node, which in this case is "Geth/v1.5.8-294c7321-20250323/linux-amd64/go1.24.0".

## Use Cases

Here are some use-cases for `web3_clientVersion` method:

1. **Client Identification**: The `web3_clientVersion` method is primarily used to identify the client software and its version that is being used to interact with the Ethereum network. This can be particularly useful for developers who need to ensure compatibility with specific client versions or when debugging issues related to client-specific implementations.

2. **Network Compatibility Checks**: Before executing certain operations, developers might want to verify that they are connected to a compatible client version. By using `web3_clientVersion`, they can programmatically check the client version and decide whether to proceed with operations that might require specific client capabilities or features.

3. **Monitoring and Analytics**: For analytics and monitoring purposes, developers or service providers might use `web3_clientVersion` to gather statistics on the distribution of client software versions used by their users. This information can help in making informed decisions about supporting specific clients or versions in their applications or services.

## Code for web3_clientVersion

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python

import requests
import json
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "Geth/v1.5.8-294c7321-20250323/linux-amd64/go1.24.0"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

```
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/";
const payload = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "Geth/v1.5.8-294c7321-20250323/linux-amd64/go1.24.0"
};

axios.post(url, payload, {
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
})
.then(response => {
  console.log("Result:", response.data.result);
})
.catch(error => {
  if (error.response) {
    console.error("Error:", error.response.status, error.response.data);
  } else {
    console.error("Request failed:", error.message);
  }
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Common Errors

When using the `web3_clientVersion` JSON-RPC API BSC method, the following issues may occur:
- **Network Latency**: If the response is delayed, it could be due to network congestion. Ensure your network connection is stable and consider using a more reliable node provider.
- **Invalid Node Configuration**: A misconfigured node might return incorrect client version details. Verify your node setup and ensure it is properly synced with the BSC network.
- **Authentication Errors**: Accessing certain nodes may require authentication. Check your credentials and ensure they have the necessary permissions to query the client version.
- **Outdated Software**: If the client version returned is outdated, it might lead to compatibility issues with newer protocols. Regularly update your node software to the latest version to maintain compatibility.

Using the `web3_clientVersion` method in Web3 applications is beneficial as it allows developers to verify the client software version they are interacting with, ensuring compatibility and stability. This method helps in diagnosing issues related to node configuration and network connectivity, ultimately contributing to a more robust and reliable application infrastructure.

## Conclusion

The `web3_clientVersion` method in JSON-RPC is a useful tool for retrieving the client version information on blockchain networks like BSC (Binance Smart Chain). By invoking `web3_clientVersion`, developers can ensure compatibility and troubleshoot issues more effectively. This method is integral to maintaining smooth interactions within the web3 ecosystem.
