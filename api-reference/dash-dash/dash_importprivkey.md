# importprivkey {disallowed} - Dash

#### Parameters

`Private key` - string (base58)

The private key to import into the wallet encoded in base58check using wallet import format (WIF).

`Account` - string

Optional.

The name of an account to which transactions involving the key should be assigned. The default is the default account, an empty string.

`Rescan` - bool

Optional.

Set to true (the default) to rescan the entire local block database for transactions affecting any address or pubkey script in the wallet (including transaction affecting the newly-added address for this private key).

Set to false to not rescan the block database (rescanning can be performed at any time by restarting Dash Core with the -rescan command-line argument).

Rescanning may take several minutes. Notes: if the address for this key is already in the wallet, the block database will not be rescanned even if this parameter is set.
