# getBlockTime - Solana

{% hint style="success" %}
The getBlockTime method in Solana retrieves the estimated production time of a specific block, identified by its slot.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The getBlockTime method is an essential part of Solanaâ€™s Core API, enabling developers to retrieve the approximate timestamp of a specific block. It is particularly useful for applications that require time-based blockchain analysis, transaction tracking, and network activity monitoring. By associating blocks with their timestamps, this method helps streamline historical data analysis and enhances the accuracy of event sequencing on the Solana blockchain.

### **Supported Networks**

The getAccountInfo RPC Solana method supports the following network types:

* Mainnet
* Devnet

### Parameters

1. block (u64, required):
   * The slot number of the block to query, represented as a 64-bit unsigned integer.

### Request

URL(Endpoints)

<pre class="language-json" data-full-width="false"><code class="lang-json"><strong>https://go.getblock.io/&#x3C;ACCESS-TOKEN>/
</strong></code></pre>

### Example (cURL):

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}
```json
curl --location "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/" -XPOST \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getBlockTime",
    "params": [122791192]
}'
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Response

The response contains the estimated UNIX timestamp for the block, returned as a 64-bit integer.

```json
{
    "id": "getblock.io",
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": 1646011316
}
```

**Response Parameters**

1. id:
   * A unique identifier for the request, matching the ID sent in the request body.
2. jsonrpc:
   * Specifies the use of JSON-RPC version 2.0.
3. result:
   * The block's estimated production time, returned as a UNIX timestamp (seconds since January 1, 1970, UTC).

### Use Case

The getBlockTime method is crucial for a variety of applications, including:

* Transaction analysis: Determining the approximate time of transactions included in a specific block.
* Blockchain monitoring: Analyzing the time intervals between blocks for performance monitoring or optimization.
* Application integration: Adding time-based metadata to transactions or blocks in wallets, explorers, or analytics tools

### Error Handling

Errors with the getBlockTime method may occur under the following conditions:

* The block parameter refers to a non-existent or invalid slot.
* The provided API key is missing, expired, or invalid.

#### Example Error Response:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "error": {
        "code": -32007,
        "message": "Slot 122791192 not found"
    },
    "id": "getblock.io"
}
```

### Code getBlockTime Example -  Web3 Integration

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/";
const headers = { "Content-Type": "application/json" };

const payload = {
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    id: 1,
    method: "getBlockTime",
    params: [122791192]
};

const fetchBlockTime = async () => {
    try {
        const response = await axios.post(url, payload, { headers });

        if (response.status === 200) {
            const blockTime = response.data.result;

            if (blockTime) {
                console.log("Block Time (UNIX):", blockTime);
                console.log("Block Time (Date):", new Date(blockTime * 1000));
            } else {
                console.log("No block time data available");
            }
        } else {
            console.error("Unexpected status:", response.status, response.statusText);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error:", error.response?.data || error.message);
    }
};

fetchBlockTime();
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Integration with Web3

The Web3 getBlockTime method is a powerful JSON-RPC tool for accessing time-based data in Solana. By querying the block parameter, developers can map slot numbers to approximate timestamps, making it easier to correlate blockchain activity with real-world events. This method is commonly used in Web3 applications for tasks such as historical data analysis, transaction time tracking, and building time-sensitive features.
