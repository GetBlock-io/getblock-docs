## Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for the `getAssetIssueListByName` method:

1. **assetName**: The name of the asset you want to retrieve the issue list for. This parameter is required to identify the specific asset.

2. **limit**: The maximum number of asset issues to return. This parameter helps to control the size of the response.

3. **offset**: The starting point for the list of asset issues. This parameter is useful for pagination, allowing you to skip a specified number of entries.

4. **sortOrder**: The order in which the asset issues should be returned, such as ascending or descending. This parameter helps in organizing the response data.

5. **includeDetails**: A boolean parameter indicating whether to include detailed information about each asset issue in the response. This can be useful if you need more than just basic information.

These parameters are used to customize the response and ensure that you receive the desired information about asset issues.

## Use Case

Here are some use-cases for the `getassetissuelistbyname` method in Web3 programming:

1. **Asset Verification and Information Retrieval**: Developers and users can utilize the `getassetissuelistbyname` method to verify the existence of a particular asset on the blockchain. By querying the blockchain for assets issued under a specific name, one can retrieve comprehensive information about the asset, including its total supply, issuer details, and issuance date. This is particularly useful for ensuring the authenticity of assets before engaging in transactions or integration into decentralized applications (dApps).

2. **Portfolio Management and Analysis**: For developers building portfolio management tools or analytics platforms, the `getassetissuelistbyname` method can be instrumental in tracking and managing digital assets. By accessing detailed information about various assets, developers can provide users with insights into their holdings, including asset performance, historical data, and potential investment opportunities. This feature enhances the user's ability to make informed decisions regarding their digital asset portfolio.

3. **Smart Contract Development and Testing**: When developing or testing smart contracts that interact with specific assets, developers can use the `getassetissuelistbyname` method to fetch necessary asset details. This ensures that the smart contract logic aligns with the asset's parameters, such as its supply and divisibility. By integrating this method into the development workflow, developers can create more robust and reliable smart contracts that handle asset interactions accurately.

## Common Errors

Common Errors  
When using the getassetissuelistbyname HTTP REST API Tron method, the following issues may occur:  
- Invalid Asset Name: If the asset name provided does not exist or is misspelled, the API will return an empty response. Ensure the asset name is correct and matches the one registered on the Tron network.  
- Network Connectivity Issues: In cases of poor network connectivity, requests to the API may time out. Verify your internet connection and try again, or consider implementing retries with exponential backoff in your application.  
- API Rate Limits: Excessive requests in a short period may trigger rate limiting, resulting in temporary blocks. Monitor your request frequency and implement rate limiting strategies to stay within the allowed thresholds.  
- Incorrect Parameter Formatting: If parameters are not formatted correctly, the API may not process the request. Double-check the parameter structure and ensure it adheres to the expected input format.  

Using the getassetissuelistbyname method in Web3 applications provides a streamlined way to retrieve detailed information about specific assets on the Tron network. This enhances the ability to manage and interact with digital assets programmatically, offering developers the tools necessary to build robust, asset-focused decentralized applications.

### conclusion

The provided JSON represents a transaction on the Tron network, involving a transfer function. To explore detailed information about assets involved in such transactions, the getassetissuelistbyname HTTP API in Tron can be utilized.
