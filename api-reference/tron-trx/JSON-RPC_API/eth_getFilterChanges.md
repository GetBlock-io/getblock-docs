# eth\_getFilterChanges - TRON

## Description

The 'eth\_getFilterChanges' method in the Tron protocol's Web3 interface is a powerful tool for developers working with blockchain events. This RPC protocol function allows users to retrieve a list of changes since the last poll for a specified filter, making it essential for applications needing real-time updates. When using 'eth\_getFilterChanges', developers can efficiently monitor and react to blockchain events without missing any critical updates. This method is invoked by passing the filter ID, and it returns an array of log objects or an empty array if no changes have occurred. By integrating 'eth\_getFilterChanges' into your Web3 applications, you can ensure seamless and timely processing of blockchain events, enhancing the responsiveness and reliability of your decentralized applications.

## Supported Networks

The eth\_getFilterChanges RPC method supports the following network types

* **Mainnet**
* **Testnets**

## Parameters

Here is the list of parameters eth\_getFilterChanges method needs to be executed.

* **Parameter**: Filter ID
  * **Required**: Yes
  * **Type**: String
  * **Description**: The filter ID is a hexadecimal string representing the unique identifier of the filter for which changes are being requested. This ID is obtained when the filter is initially created using methods like `eth_newFilter`.
  * **Default/Supported Values**: A valid filter ID in hexadecimal format (e.g., "0xc11a84d5e906ecb9f5c1eb65ee940b154ad37dce8f5ac29c80764508b901d996").

### URL

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```

Hereâ€™s a sample cURL request using eth\_getFilterChanges

Request

```json
curl --location --request POST 'https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/jsonrpc' 
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "eth_getFilterChanges", "params": ["0xc11a84d5e906ecb9f5c1eb65ee940b154ad37dce8f5ac29c80764508b901d996"], "id": "getblock.io"}
```

Response

```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "getblock.io",
  "error": {
    "code": -32000,
    "message": "filter not found",
    "data": "{}
```

## Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for the `eth_getFilterChanges` method:

1. **jsonrpc**: A string specifying the version of the JSON-RPC protocol. For Ethereum, this is typically "2.0".
2. **id**: A unique identifier for the request. This can be any string or number, and it is used to match the response with the request.
3. **error**: An object that is included only if there was an error processing the request. It contains the following fields:
   * **code**: A number indicating the error code. For example, `-32000` is a common error code indicating a problem with the filter.
   * **message**: A string providing a short description of the error.
   * **data**: Additional data about the error, if available. This is typically an empty object or string.
4. **result**: An array of log objects, or an empty array if no changes have occurred since the last poll. Each log object contains the following fields:
   * **removed**: A boolean indicating whether the log was removed due to a chain reorganization.
   * **logIndex**: The index position of the log in the block.
   * **transactionIndex**: The index position of the transaction in the block that generated this log.
   * **transactionHash**: The hash of the transaction that generated this log.
   * **blockHash**: The hash of the block where this log was found.
   * **blockNumber**: The block number where this log was found.
   * **address**: The address from which this log originated.
   * **data**: The data contained in the log.
   * **topics**: An array of strings representing indexed log arguments.

## Use Case

Here are some use-cases for the `eth_getFilterChanges` method:

1. **Real-time Event Monitoring**: One of the primary use cases for the `eth_getFilterChanges` method is to monitor blockchain events in real-time. Developers can create a filter to listen for specific events emitted by smart contracts. By periodically calling `eth_getFilterChanges`, they can retrieve all new events that have occurred since the last check. This is particularly useful in decentralized applications (dApps) that need to respond to blockchain events, such as updates to a user's balance or changes in a smart contract's state.
2. **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Instead of constantly polling the blockchain for new data, developers can use `eth_getFilterChanges` to efficiently retrieve only the changes that have occurred since the last call. This reduces the amount of data transferred and processed, which is especially beneficial for applications with limited bandwidth or processing power. For instance, a dApp that tracks token transfers can use this method to update its interface only when new transfers occur, minimizing unnecessary data handling.
3. **Transaction Confirmation Tracking**: Another use case involves tracking the confirmation status of transactions. By setting up a filter for pending transactions or specific transaction hashes, developers can use `eth_getFilterChanges` to check when a transaction has been mined and confirmed. This allows dApps to update their UI or notify users once their transactions have been successfully processed, enhancing the user experience by providing timely feedback on transaction statuses.

## Code for eth\_getFilterChanges

```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "eth_getFilterChanges", "params": ["0xc11a84d5e906ecb9f5c1eb65ee940b154ad37dce8f5ac29c80764508b901d996"], "id": "getblock.io"}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)
```

## Common Errors

Common Errors\
When using the eth\_getFilterChanges RPC Tron method, the following issues may occur:

* Invalid filter ID: If the filter ID provided is incorrect or has expired, the method will return an error. Ensure that the filter ID is valid and still active by checking its creation and usage context.
* Network connectivity issues: Poor network connectivity can lead to timeouts or incomplete data retrieval. Verify your network status and consider implementing retries with exponential backoff to handle transient network failures.
* Insufficient permissions: If the node you are interacting with requires authentication, insufficient permissions can prevent access to filter changes. Confirm that your API credentials or access tokens are correctly configured and have the necessary permissions.
* Node synchronization lag: If the node is not fully synchronized with the Tron network, it may return outdated or incomplete filter changes. Ensure your node is fully synced before making requests to get accurate data.

Using the eth\_getFilterChanges method in Web3 applications allows for efficient monitoring of state changes on the Tron blockchain. By retrieving only the latest changes since the last poll, developers can minimize data processing and enhance application performance. This method is particularly beneficial for building responsive and resource-efficient decentralized applications.

### conclusion

The `eth_getFilterChanges` RPC method is a crucial tool for developers working with Ethereum, as it allows them to poll for changes in a specific filter, such as new blocks or transactions. While this method is specific to Ethereum, similar concepts exist in other blockchain platforms like Tron, which also provide mechanisms for tracking changes in the blockchain state. Understanding and utilizing `eth_getFilterChanges` effectively can significantly enhance the efficiency of decentralized application development and monitoring.
