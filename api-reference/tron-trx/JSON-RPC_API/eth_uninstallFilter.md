# eth\_uninstallFilter - TRON

## Description

The 'eth\_uninstallFilter' Web3 method in the Tron protocol is a crucial part of the eth\_uninstallFilter RPC protocol, designed to enhance resource management by removing previously installed filters. This method is particularly useful for developers who need to manage and optimize their application's performance by ensuring that unnecessary filters do not consume resources. When invoked, 'eth\_uninstallFilter' takes a single parameter, the filter ID, which identifies the specific filter to be removed. By doing so, it helps maintain a streamlined and efficient interaction with the blockchain, preventing the accumulation of unused filters that could otherwise degrade performance. This method is an essential tool for developers using the JSON-RPC API Interface to build applications on the Tron network.

## Supported Networks

The eth\_uninstallFilter RPC method supports the following network types

* **Mainnet**
* **Testnets**

## Parameters

Here is the list of parameters eth\_uninstallFilter method needs to be executed.

* **Filter ID**
  * **Type**: String
  * **Description**: The ID of the filter to uninstall.
  * **Required**: Yes
  * **Default/Supported Values**: This should be a valid filter ID, typically represented as a hexadecimal string prefixed with "0x".

### URL

```json
https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
```

Here’s a sample cURL request using eth\_uninstallFilter

Request

```json
curl --location --request POST 'https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/jsonrpc' 
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "eth_uninstallFilter", "params": ["0xc11a84d5e906ecb9f5c1eb65ee940b154ad37dce8f5ac29c80764508b901d996"], "id": "getblock.io"}
```

Response

```json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "getblock.io",
  "error": {
    "code": -32000,
    "message": "filter not found",
    "data": "{}
```

## Body Parameters

Here is the list of body parameters for the `eth_uninstallFilter` method:

1. **jsonrpc**: A string specifying the version of the JSON-RPC protocol. For Ethereum, this is typically "2.0".
2. **id**: A unique identifier for the request. This can be any string or number that the client uses to match responses to their corresponding requests.
3. **result**: A boolean value indicating whether the filter was successfully uninstalled. If `true`, the filter was successfully removed; if `false`, the filter was not found or could not be uninstalled.
4. **error**: An object containing error information, if applicable. This includes:
   * **code**: A numeric code representing the error type.
   * **message**: A short description of the error.
   * **data**: Additional data providing more context about the error, if available.

## Use Case

Here are some use-cases for the `eth_uninstallFilter` method:

1. **Resource Management**: In a Web3 application, filters are used to listen for specific events or changes on the Ethereum blockchain. However, if a filter is no longer needed, it continues to consume resources unnecessarily. By using the `eth_uninstallFilter` method, developers can efficiently manage resources by removing unused filters, ensuring that the application does not waste computational power or bandwidth on irrelevant data.
2. **Improving Application Performance**: Over time, an application may create multiple filters as it listens for various blockchain events. If these filters are not properly managed, they can lead to performance degradation. By uninstalling filters that are no longer required, developers can enhance the application's performance, reducing latency and improving the overall user experience.
3. **Security and Privacy**: Filters can inadvertently expose sensitive information if they continue to listen for events that are no longer relevant. By uninstalling such filters, developers can enhance the security and privacy of their applications, ensuring that only necessary data is being monitored and processed. This proactive management helps in safeguarding user information and maintaining the integrity of the application.

## Code for eth\_uninstallFilter

```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "eth_uninstallFilter", "params": ["0xc11a84d5e906ecb9f5c1eb65ee940b154ad37dce8f5ac29c80764508b901d996"], "id": "getblock.io"}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)
```

## Common Errors

Common Errors\
When using the eth\_uninstallFilter RPC Tron method, the following issues may occur:

* Invalid filter ID: This error occurs when the filter ID provided does not exist or is incorrectly formatted. Ensure that the filter ID is correct and still active before attempting to uninstall it.
* Network connectivity issues: If there is a disruption in the connection to the Tron network, the method may fail to execute. Verify your network connection and try again.
* Unauthorized access: The method may return an error if the caller does not have the necessary permissions to uninstall the filter. Confirm that your account has the appropriate permissions to perform this action.
* Internal server error: Occasionally, the Tron node may experience internal issues that prevent the method from executing. In such cases, retrying the request or switching to a different node may resolve the problem.

Using the eth\_uninstallFilter method in Web3 applications allows developers to efficiently manage filter resources by removing unnecessary filters once they are no longer needed. This helps optimize network performance and resource utilization, ensuring smoother and more reliable operations within decentralized applications.

### conclusion

The `eth_uninstallFilter` RPC method is used in Ethereum to remove a filter that was previously created using methods like `eth_newFilter`. This operation helps manage resources by ensuring that unnecessary filters do not consume memory or processing power. While Ethereum and Tron are distinct blockchain platforms, understanding such RPC methods is crucial for developers working with Ethereum's JSON-RPC API, as it allows for more efficient and effective network interactions.
