## Code for gettransactioninfobyblocknum

```python
import requests

url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/walletsolidity/gettransactioninfobyblocknum"
headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
    "num": 20000000  
}

try:
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    response.raise_for_status()  
    print(response.json())
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error making request: {e}")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error decoding JSON response: {e}")
```

## Common Errors

**Common Errors**\
When using the `gettransactioninfobyblocknum` REST Tron method, the following issues may occur:

* **Invalid block number**: The specified block number may not exist or be out of range. Ensure the block is confirmed and within the chain's current height.
* **Node synchronization issues**: The node may not be fully synced, leading to missing or incomplete data. Verify the node's sync status before querying.
* **Rate limiting**: Excessive requests can trigger rate limits, resulting in temporary access restrictions. Implement request throttling or use a load-balanced node.

The `gettransactioninfobyblocknum` method is invaluable for Web3 apps, enabling efficient retrieval of transaction details by block number. It simplifies auditing and tracking on-chain activity, making it ideal for explorers, analytics tools, and decentralized applications.

### conclusion

In conclusion, the **gettransactioninfobyblocknum** REST method is a powerful tool for querying transaction details within specific blocks on the **Tron** blockchain. By leveraging this **Tron** RPC call, developers can efficiently retrieve critical transaction data, enhancing transparency and auditability. Whether for analytics or debugging, **gettransactioninfobyblocknum** proves essential for seamless blockchain interactions.
