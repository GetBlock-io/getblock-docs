## Code for gettransactioninfobyblocknum


```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = 

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

# Check the response and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Result:", response.json().get("result"))
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)
```
## Common Errors

**Common Errors**  
When using the `gettransactioninfobyblocknum` RPC Tron method, the following issues may occur:  
- **Invalid block number**: The specified block number may not exist or be out of range. Ensure the block is confirmed and within the chain's current height.  
- **Node synchronization issues**: The node may not be fully synced, leading to missing or incomplete data. Verify the node's sync status before querying.  
- **Rate limiting**: Excessive requests can trigger rate limits, resulting in temporary access restrictions. Implement request throttling or use a load-balanced node.  

The `gettransactioninfobyblocknum` method is invaluable for Web3 apps, enabling efficient retrieval of transaction details by block number. It simplifies auditing and tracking on-chain activity, making it ideal for explorers, analytics tools, and decentralized applications.

### conclusion

In conclusion, the **gettransactioninfobyblocknum** RPC method is a powerful tool for querying transaction details within specific blocks on the **Tron** blockchain. By leveraging this **Tron** RPC call, developers can efficiently retrieve critical transaction data, enhancing transparency and auditability. Whether for analytics or debugging, **gettransactioninfobyblocknum** proves essential for seamless blockchain interactions.
