# Team accounts setup

A team account is **a shared workspace** **where multiple users can collaborate**. This setup is ideal for companies and teams using GetBlock services.

**Key benefits:**

* **Organized collaboration:** Work together on company resources.
* **Enhanced security:** Role-based access limits each member to only the features they need.
* **Efficient management:** Easily switch between personal and team accounts.

A **team account user** is a regular GetBlock user. When invited to a team, they can work on company resources, manage service plans or team settings‚Äîprovided the corresponding permissions are granted. &#x20;

### Creating a team account on GetBlock

This part covers a step-by-step guide to setting up your team workspace.

2. Click on the **profile icon** in the bottom-left corner of the sidebar. Select "**Create new team**" from the dropdown menu.

### Adding teammates

The creator of the team account controls who gets invited and manages user roles.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Limits on GetBlock team accounts:**

* Each user can create up to **3 teams**.
* A user can be invited to an **unlimited number of teams**.
* One team can have a maximum of **30 users.**
{% endhint %}

You can invite team members to join your team account using either their email address or GetBlock User ID.&#x20;

* **If the teammate has a GetBlock account**: You can invite them using their **ID**. Since they are already registered, they just need to accept the invitation.
* **If the teammate is not registered on GetBlock**: Invite them via **email** so they can first create an account before joining the team.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="The teammate has a GetBlock account" %}
1. Go to **Account Settings > My Team**.
2. Click **"Add team member"** in the top-right corner.
3. Request the **User ID** from the teammate (they can find it under **Account Settings** > **General**).
4. Enter the name, User I&#x44;**,** and **send the invite**.&#x20;

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

A team member is marked as ![Active](<../../.gitbook/assets/Component 20.svg>) when they have successfully accepted the invitation and joined the team.&#x20;

If the invitation has been sent but not yet accepted, their status remains ![Pending](<../../.gitbook/assets/Component 21.svg>).

Once registered, you‚Äôll have your personal GetBlock account. Additionally, you gain access to the team‚Äôs dashboard and resources based on [permissions](team-accounts-setup.md#roles-based-permissions) given by the team owner or admin.

### **Switching between personal & team accounts**

{% hint style="success" %}
A team user **does not lose** access to their personal account. They can still use and manage their own endpoints and subscriptions.
{% endhint %}

To switch between your personal account and any team accounts you are part of:

* Click the **account icon** in the left panel.&#x20;
* A dropdown will show all **teams & personal accounts**.&#x20;
* Switch between them as needed.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Switching_accounts.svg" alt="Using GetBlock&#x27;s personal and team accounts"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The teams list is sorted by recent activity, with the most recently accessed accounts at the top.

***

### **Best practices for team security**

* Regularly review and **audit permissions**. Revoke access for users who are no longer active.
* Grant admin privileges only to **trusted team members**.&#x20;
* Give Members **only the necessary permissions** (e.g., endpoints access or subscriptions management).
* Never **share login credentials**‚Äîuse team accounts instead.
