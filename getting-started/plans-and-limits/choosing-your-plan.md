# Choosing your plan

GetBlock offers three main service options—**Shared Nodes**, **Dedicated Nodes**, and **Enterprise Solutions**. This page provides a high-level overview of these services.

You can explore detailed pricing and plans from your **dashboard** in the “Pricing” section or via [https://getblock.io/pricing/](https://getblock.io/pricing/).

***

### Shared nodes

Shared nodes operate on a **resource-sharing model**, where multiple clients access the same underlying node infrastructure maintained by GetBlock.&#x20;

Our Shared Nodes deliver the perfect balance between affordability and performance:&#x20;

* **Cost efficiency:** Benefit from our pricing model based on [**Compute Units (CU)**](what-counts-as-a-cu.md), so you only pay for the resources needed for your current workload.&#x20;
* **Flexible pricing**: Options range from a **free** to **high-volume plans —** accessible for individual developers and smaller teams while supporting the scaling needs of growing dApps.
* **Consistent performance**: Each plan enforces a Requests Per Second (RPS) limit, preventing individual spikes from impacting overall quality.
* **Multi-chain accessibility**: Prototype, test, and deploy applications across different networks without the complexities of deploying infrastructure for each blockchain individually.
* **Regional endpoints**: Connect to the nearest datacenter — Frankfurt (EU), New York (US), Singapore (APAC) — to minimize network latency.
* **Archive data access**: Run full historical blockchain queries.
* **Tiered support levels**: Support options adapt to your requirements, from basic help to priority support when you need it most.

### Dedicated nodes

A Dedicated Node is a **private RPC server** deployed solely for your use case. That means consistent throughput, no API rate throttling due to other users, and better uptime guarantees.

{% hint style="success" %}
If your project demands the fastest, most reliable blockchain infrastructure, a Dedicated Node from GetBlock is a perfect choice.
{% endhint %}

This option is ideal for users that require high performance, full control over node configuration, and a flawless connection to the blockchain without any limitations:

* **Mission-critical reliability**: Maximized uptime and robust failover mechanisms for even more reliable service.
* **Unlimited usage**: No per-second request caps or CU tracking.&#x20;
* **Low latency**: With servers available in **Europe**, **Asia**, and **the USA**, choose the optimal server location to minimize latency and enhance performance for your users.
* **Fully customizable**: Complete control over your node configurations, including access to archive data.
* **Predictable pricing**:
  * Full Node:  from $1,000/month;
  * Archive Node: from $1,500/ month.
* **Expert support**: 24/7 coverage and immediate issue resolution.

{% hint style="info" %}
A few **high-resource blockchain** settings (e.g., Solana mainnet, Arbitrum mainnet, NEAR mainnet) may come with **custom pricing** due to their intense infrastructure requirements.
{% endhint %}
