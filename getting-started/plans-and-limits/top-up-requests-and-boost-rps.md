# Top up CUs and boost limits

The current **CU balance** **for Shared Node** users is displayed on the **Dashboard**. This shows how many Compute Units (CUs) are left before running out.&#x20;

With the "**Top Up**" feature, users can add more **Compute Units** to their account or upgrade to higher monthly limits.

***

### Add Compute Units: Paid plan users

1. Click the "**Top Up**" button on the **Dashboard**.
2. Select the **number of CUs** you’d like to add or choose the recommended plan (if prompted) based on your usage needs.
3. **Confirm** and finalize your purchase.

Your account balance will be updated immediately upon successful payment.

### **Increase CU limits: Free plan users**

Free plan users **cannot top up their Compute Units directly**. Instead, you have the option to upgrade to one of our monthly paid plans, providing significantly higher limits and extra features.

### Boost CU, RPS, and Access Token limits

If you're on the **Enterprise** plan (our customizable Shared Node plan), you can additionally request **higher RPS and Access Token limits**. Here’s how:

1. Click "**Change**" on the Dashboard next to the **Rate Limit** section.
