# What counts as a CU

In our **Shared Node** plans, we use **CU-based pricing**. **CUs, Compute Units,** is a way to measure the computational resources that each API request consumes.

{% hint style="info" %}
### Request vs CU

**Requests** are the raw number of calls (e.g., an RPC method call) you make to the node, while **Compute Units** show how much computing power each call uses.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Instead of charging a fixed fee for every call, GetBlock calculates the ‚Äúcost‚Äù of processing a request based on **the actual computational work involved** ‚Äì such as CPU & memory usage, and disk I/O.

Here's how it works:

* Different shared node plans include different allocations of Compute Units (CUs).&#x20;
* Each API call deducts an amount based on the resources it consumes.&#x20;
* Users can track their remaining CUs in real time on the dashboard.&#x20;

This model ensures costs are aligned with actual infrastructure usage.

### How CUs are calculated

Every API call "spends" a number of Compute Units. The total value is determined by two main factors:

1. A **base CU cost** (chain multiplier) reflecting the network's resource intensity.
2. A **method-specific multiplier** which varies by API method.

The total Compute Units for an API call are calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text{Total CU} = \text{Chain Multiplier} \times \text{Method Multiplier}
$$

#### 1. Chain-based multipliers

Not all blockchains are built or operate the same way. GetBlock accounts for inherent differences between networks by assigning **chain multipliers** based on factors such as:

* Node infrastructure costs;
* Protocol complexity and the size of the blockchain data;
* Operational overhead.

Here‚Äôs how blockchains are grouped based on their average resource intensity:

<table><thead><tr><th width="340.78125" align="center">Chains</th><th width="110.8125" align="center">Multiplier</th><th align="center">Explanation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Algorand, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Dogecoin, Ethereum Classic, Kusama, Litecoin, Near, OKB, Polkadot, RSK, Scroll, Shiba Inu, Sonic, Syscoin, Telos, Zcash, <em>others</em></td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">These chains typically have low write/read complexity and use fewer resources per request</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, BNB Smart Chain, Base, Blast, Cardano, Cosmos, Cronos, Ethereum, Filecoin, Flow, Gnosis, Harmony, Kaia, Linea, Moonbeam, OKT, Optimism, Polygon, Polygon zkEVM, StarkNet, Tezos, Tron, XRP, opBNB, zkCronos, zkSync</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">Requests on these blockchains are more resource-intensive</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Solana, Sui, TON</td><td align="center">50</td><td align="center">These chains require significantly more computational resources per request</td></tr></tbody></table>

***

#### 2. Method-specific multipliers

Different API methods **put different loads on backend nodes**. For example:

* <mark style="color:green;">`eth_blockNumber`</mark> is lightweight since it just returns the latest block number.
* <mark style="color:green;">`trace_replayBlockTransactions`</mark> executes a full replay of all txs in a block and can be extremely heavy.

Therefore, individual blockchain methods have their own multipliers, depending on how computationally demanding each particular operation is.

The example table below shows some **Ethereum blockchain methods** with their associated multipliers and total CU calculated.&#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th width="271.0625">Ethereum RPC Method</th><th align="center">Method Multiplier</th><th align="center">Base Chain Multiplier</th><th align="center">Total CU</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>eth_blockNumber</code></td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">20</td></tr><tr><td><code>eth_getTransactionByHash</code></td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">20</td></tr><tr><td><code>debug_traceTransaction</code></td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">40</td></tr><tr><td><code>debug_traceBlock</code></td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">40</td></tr><tr><td><code>trace_call</code></td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">40</td></tr><tr><td><code>trace_transaction</code></td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">40</td></tr><tr><td><code>txpool_status</code></td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">40</td></tr><tr><td><code>trace_replayTransaction</code></td><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">80</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
Some "heavy" calls (e.g. archive calls) may have special adjustments or additional weighting to more accurately reflect their extra computational demands
{% endhint %}

> Calculation example for <mark style="color:green;">`debug_traceTransaction`</mark>: \
> \
> $$20\ (\text{Ethereum base multiplier}) \times 2\ (\text{method multiplier}) = \mathbf{40\ CU}$$

### Why we use the CU system at GetBlock?

#### üõ°Ô∏è **It helps keep infrastructure stable**

Tracking and pricing requests based on how ‚Äúheavy‚Äù they are:

* Discourages abuse (like hammering archive calls) and protects node performance & uptime.
* Makes it easier for GetBlock to scale and optimize resources behind the scenes.

#### üí∞ **Compute Units provide a fair, usage-based billing model**&#x20;

A simple per-request pricing model would charge the same for all methods, which isn‚Äôt scalable or logical. The CU model fixes this imbalance.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è To h**elp developers build smarter**&#x20;

Because each API call has a clear CU cost, you can spot inefficiencies quickly (e.g. which parts of your dApp consume the most), making it easier to fine-tune performance.
